# Aragon Network Token

The Aragon Network Token (ticker symbol: ANT) is the native token of the Aragon Network. ANT is primarily used for the governance of the Aragon Network, although additional uses for accessing Aragon Network services have been proposed as well.

## ANT uses

**Governance**  

The first use of ANT is as a Sybil-resistant mechanism for governance. In the [Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md#aragon-network-votes), which was [first approved by ANT holders](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) on November 17, 2018, one ANT equals one vote. This means that anyone can vote on AGPs, even while remaining pseudonymous, by acquiring and holding ANT at the time of the Aragon Network vote they want to participate in. ANT can also be used to vote on proposals in the [Community Funding DAO](https://forum.aragon.org/t/how-to-make-proposals-to-the-community-funding-dao/697), which was first proposed in [AGP-10](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-10.md), approved in [Aragon Network Vote #1](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/), and [deployed](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-discussion-community-funding-dao/418/36) on March 18, 2019.

**Aragon Court**  

With the launch of the Aragon Network and the Aragon Court, the [current plan](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-and-token-primer/) is for it to be possible to deposit ANT in a bonding curve to mint Aragon Network Juror (ANJ) tokens, which will be required to stake and become a juror in the Aragon Court. More information about the use of ANT and ANJ in the Aragon Court can be found in the [Aragon Network whitepaper](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper).

**Aragon Chain**  

In a [blog post announcing Aragon Chain](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-chain/), a Proof-of-Stake blockchain built for the Aragon community, the Aragon One team has proposed that ANT could be deposited into a bonding curve to mint Aragon Chain (ARA) tokens. These tokens would be required to stake and become a validator for the Aragon Chain. With [AGP-106](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-106.md) approved in Aragon Network Vote #4, the blockchain development company ChainSafe is now the team responsible for putting the Aragon Chain plan into action. 

## Initial token distribution

ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a [public token sale](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-the-aragon-network-token-sale-fe83fe36902c) that took place on [May 17, 2017](https://blog.aragon.org/final-token-sale-recap-1ac64ab7cfcd) - starting at Ethereum block 3,723,000 to be exact. Less than 100 blocks later, 275,000 ETH worth of ANT were sold. Added together with ANT sold in the pre-sale, ANT granted to the Aragon Foundation/Association, and ANT granted to founders and early contributors, the total initial supply of ANT after the token sale is 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT.

### Initial supply breakdown

|  | Amount (ANT)	| % of initial supply |
|:------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Public sale + Pre-sale grant | 27,726,666.666666666678 ANT | 70% |
| Aragon Foundation grant | 5,941,428.571428571431 ANT | 15% |
| Early contributors and founders grant | 5,941,428.571428571431 ANT | 15% |

Total supply: 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT`*`

> `*` Total supply will be constant only until the AN (Aragon Network) is deployed. From then on, ANT holders will use Aragon Network governance to decide the monetary policy and inflation rate going forward.

## Technical details

ANT is an ERC-20 token using the [MiniMe standard](https://github.com/giveth/minime). As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo [wrote](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-token-sale-technical-overview-9c2a4b910755) on the Aragon blog:

> We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime) is an ERC20 token created by the [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there).
>
> In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, weâ€™re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations.
