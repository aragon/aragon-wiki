# Aragon Network Token

Aragon Network Token (ticker symbol: ANT) is the native token of the Aragon Network. ANT is primarily used for the governance of the Aragon Network, although additional uses for accessing Aragon Network services have been proposed as well.

## ANT uses

### Governance  

The first use of ANT is as a Sybil-resistant mechanism for governance. In the [Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md#aragon-network-votes), which was [first approved by ANT holders](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) on November 17, 2018, one ANT was equal to one vote. This meant that anyone could vote on AGPs, even while remaining pseudonymous, by acquiring and holding ANT at the time of the Aragon Network vote they want to participate in. 

ANT can also be used to vote on proposals in the [Community Funding DAO](https://forum.aragon.org/t/how-to-make-proposals-to-the-community-funding-dao/697), which was first proposed in [AGP-10](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-10.md), approved in [Aragon Network Vote #1](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/), and [deployed](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-discussion-community-funding-dao/418/36) on March 18, 2019.

On March 13, 2020, ANT holders [voted to sunset the AGP process](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-6/) in preparation for Phase 3 of the [Aragon Network launch](overview/#the-aragon-network-launch).

### Aragon Court
From the [ANJ article](https://help.aragon.org/article/44-how-to-get-anj-and-become-an-aragon-court-juror#bonding-curve) at the Aragon Help Desk:

> ANJ (Aragon Network Juror) is the native token of Aragon Court, which jurors need to activate in the Court to be selected and earn dispute fees. The use of ANJ helps align the incentives of jurors with the long-term health of the Court, ensuring the Court's integrity.

ANJ is minted by depositing ANT into a bonding curve smart contract. The ANJ bonding curve went live with the official launch of Aragon Court on Fight For Freedom Day February 10, 2020.

Continuing from the ANJ Help Desk article:

> ANJ is a continuous token, the supply of which is regulated by a bonding curve. A bonding curve is an automated market maker smart contract that defines a relationship between token price and token supply. 
> 
> ANT is the reserve token used to back the ANJ supply. As more ANT is deposited in the ANJ bonding curve, the total supply of ANJ increases; as ANT is withdrawn from the bonding curve, the total supply of ANJ decreases.
> 
> The bonding curve is used to convert ANT into ANJ and back at pre-defined rates. The way the ANJ bonding curve is set up, the more ANT is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer new ANJ will be released back to the sender; the more ANJ is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer ANT will be released back to the sender.
> 
> You can find a technical explanation of bonding curves [here](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves) and find the source code for the specific smart contract used for the ANJ bonding curve [here](https://github.com/AragonBlack/fundraising/blob/next/apps/batched-bancor-market-maker/contracts/BatchedBancorMarketMaker.sol).

More information about the use of ANT and ANJ in Aragon Court can be found in the [Aragon Network whitepaper](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper).

## Initial token distribution

ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a [public token sale](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-the-aragon-network-token-sale-fe83fe36902c) that took place on [May 17, 2017](https://blog.aragon.org/final-token-sale-recap-1ac64ab7cfcd) - starting at Ethereum block 3,723,000 to be exact. Less than 100 blocks later, 275,000 ETH worth of ANT were sold. Added together with ANT sold in the pre-sale, ANT granted to the Aragon Institute (now the Aragon Association), and ANT granted to founders and early contributors, the total initial supply of ANT after the token sale is 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT.

### Initial supply breakdown

|  | Amount (ANT)	| % of initial supply |
|:------------- |:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Public sale + Pre-sale grant | 27,726,666.666666666678 ANT | 70% |
| Aragon Foundation grant | 5,941,428.571428571431 ANT | 15% |
| Early contributors and founders grant | 5,941,428.571428571431 ANT | 15% |

Total supply: 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT`*`

> `*` Total supply will be constant only until the Aragon Network is deployed. From then on, ANT holders will use Aragon Network governance to decide the ANT issuance policy and inflation rate going forward.

## ANT upgrade

On October 22, 2020 the Aragon Association announced a coordinated upgrade of the ANT smart contract. To upgrade their tokens, ANT holders can send their ANTv1 to a migration contract and receive an equivalent amount of ANTv2 in return.

### ANTv1 technical details

ANTv1 is an ERC-20 token using the [MiniMe standard](https://github.com/giveth/minime). As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo [wrote](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-token-sale-technical-overview-9c2a4b910755) on the Aragon blog:

> We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime) is an ERC20 token created by the [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there).
>
> In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, weâ€™re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations.

The Ethereum smart contract address of ANTv1 is `0x960b236A07cf122663c4303350609A66A7B288C0`.

### ANTv2 technical details  

ANTv2 is an ERC-20 token with built-in support for "gasless" metatransactions. With the changes made to the token contract, gas costs of using ANTv2 are approximately one-third the cost of using ANTv1.

The Ethereum smart contract address of ANTv2 is `0xa117000000f279D81A1D3cc75430fAA017FA5A2e`.

## ANT asset analysis

On October 22, 2019, Aragon One Researcher Luke Duncan published an analysis of ANT entitled "[ANT Demand Modeling Framework](https://forum.aragon.org/t/ant-demand-modeling-framework/1389)". Duncan described the document as "a basic framework for thinking about the demand for the Aragon Network Token (ANT) based on its current and potential future utility value".

On March 6, 2020, the venture capital firm Placeholder published an analysis of ANT entitled "[Aragon (ANT) Economics](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/3/6/aragon-ant-economics)". Placeholder refers to ANT in their analysis as "a governance asset, with planned future economics to reinforce its store-of-value status".
