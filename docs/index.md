## What is Aragon?

**Disintermediating human trade — business — is the first step towards a more fair, efficient world**

Aragon lets you manage entire organizations using the blockchain. This makes Aragon organizations more efficient than their traditional counterparties.

By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling the borderless, permissionless creation of value.

**Death to paperwork. Avoid useless intermediaries**

Aragon companies are powered by [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/), a blockchain global computing platform.

A blockchain is a distributed, append-only database hardened against tampering and revision that provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth.

This ensures that your company will always work, even if a government or malicious third party tries to tamper with it.

In Ethereum, code is immutable and everything is explicitly encoded. It is not up to random interpretation.

**The Aragon Network: A digital jurisdiction**

The Aragon Network (AN) will be the first DAO whose goal is to act as a **digital jurisdiction** that makes it extremely easy and friendly for organizations, entrepreneurs and investors to operate.

Aragon organizations will be able to be **seamlessly upgraded** and solve human disputes using a **decentralized court** system.

The Aragon Network has its own token, **ANT**, which will be used to govern every single aspect of its functioning.

### Why

Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services.

However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks.

Aragon was born to **disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies** and other organizational structures.

We were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper [The Nature of the Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_the_Firm) and Yochai Benkler's [Linux and the Nature of the Firm](http://www.benkler.org/CoasesPenguin.html). Both explore the concept of company.

We believe that the **blockchain** and the **Internet** are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the **next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes**.
