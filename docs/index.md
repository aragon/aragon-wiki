## What is Aragon?

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">DEMOCRATIZING GOVERNANCE</h4>
**The first step towards a more fair, efficient world**

> We are building Aragon because we believe [decentralized organizations can solve the world’s worst problems](https://blog.aragon.org/decentralized-organizations-can-solve-the-worlds-worst-problems-840db6255d12).

Aragon is a project that aims to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizational structures by using blockchain technology. We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives.

By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">GOODBYE UNNECESSARY INTERMEDIARIES</h4>
**Reclaim your independence**

> Aragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship.

Blockchain technology provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth. This is secured by a network made up of thousands of computers all over the globe. Anyone can set up their own node where all the necessary data is replicated across the network.

This decentralized design ensures a borderless and permissionless way of operating, without the fear of a government or a malicious third-party interfering.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">IMAGINE A NATION WITHOUT LAND AND BORDERS</h4>
**A digital jurisdiction**

> Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isn’t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country.

Aragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues.

The Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future.

### **Aragon client**

<h2>Decentralized application to run your organization</h2>

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">TRANSFER TOKENS</h4>
**Tokens represent your stake in the organization**

Your organization is in control of its funds. Transfer and assign them according to your personal needs without artificial limitations.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">FUNDRAISING</h4>
**Grasp the potential of a new form of crowdfunding**

Utilize the power of the crowd for funding and raise funds globally, in private or publicly, without relying on banks or financial gatekeepers.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">VOTING</h4>
**Decision-making by voting**

Use voting for more effective results. Votes are a secure, transparent and unforgeable way to come to a decision on major issues.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">PAYMENTS</h4>
**Instant payments in a few clicks**

Adding a new employee to your organization and payroll is as easy as creating a new recurring payment.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">ACCOUNTING</h4>
**Tamper-proof, effective accounting**

> Every transaction is recorded and can be verified on the blockchain at any given time

Unprecedented level of transparency can be gained through the use of a public blockchain to engrave every entry permanently on the ledger.

Pre-established rules can automatically define your quarterly spending and budgeting.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">PERMISSIONS</h4>
**Flexible and resilient privilege escalation**

> Fine-grained permissions deliver the freedom to create an organization that will work for you.

Permissions can be granular and assigned in fine detail. You can choose to give people a certain degree of control over the organization and privileges can be escalated easily through a voting or different mechanisms if the person isn't allowed to directly perform a desired action.

By assigning different permissions to people, you can create the kind of organizational structure that is best suited for your needs.

### **Aragon Network**

<h2>Ensuring the success of decentralized organizations</h2>

**Putting the power back into the hands of the users**

> The Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users.

The Aragon Network will establish additional services for the organizations taking advantage of what Aragon provides.

Our mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">ARAGON GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS</h4>
**[Join us in improving Aragon by making your voice heard](https://github.com/aragon/governance/issues)**

[Aragon Governance Proposals](https://github.com/aragon/governance/issues) is a system for community members to join the discussion and create proposals affecting Aragon.

Everyone is welcome to [join in and aid](https://github.com/aragon/governance/issues) in forging the future of how Aragon will shape out to be. Together we can build the exciting future we want to see.

### **Why Aragon?**

> Aragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization. We want to give the users the freedom they deserve to run their lives.

Organizations like companies exist to create value for their owners and users. They use the resources available to them in order to provide services and to create products.

Their ability to do this efficiently is hindered by factors outside of their influence. By removing unnecessary intermediaries and third parties that impose artificial restrictions and unnecessarily complex regulations, we can modernize the way organizations are run.

<h4 style="color:#00CBE6;">OUR VISION</h4>
**Evolution of the internet and blockchain technology are changing the ways we interact with each other**

We believe that the progression of modern technology solutions, such as the invention of the blockchain, are changing the incentives for people to interact with each other. We are building the tools for the next generation of organizations to take advantage of this revolution.

Experimenting with new governance models has been a very risky endeavour during previous iterations of society. Now, for the first time in human history, we can let a thousand new governance models emerge, all from the comfort of our laptops.

## Teams

> _To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Association to form a company of core developers. Everyone currently employed by the Association will become employees of a new company funded by the Association. That way, **we level the playing field for other teams to join the core development of the project**._

With [Aragon Nest](https://github.com/aragon/nest) we are already supporting projects that are not necessarily sustainable by themselves yet, but are crucial to the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems.

**We will expand the scope of Nest to start funding alternative teams** that have a desire to work on the [**Aragon client**](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started.html), [**aragonOS**](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref.html) and on [**Aragon Apps**](dev/apps/).

Since we released the first version of the [Aragon whitepaper](documentation/whitepaper.md), we knew that it was important to **split the non-profit entity** overseeing the project [**from the actual companies or teams working on its development**](https://blog.aragon.org/the-path-to-mainstream-decentralized-organizations-d95a89d3cac4).

For more context, we've published three blog posts about why it makes sense to [decentralize Aragon's development](https://blog.aragon.org/decentralizing-aragons-development-5062fd6d135d), [the steps forward for the non-profit entity](https://blog.aragon.org/decentralizing-aragons-development-ii-minimum-viable-foundation-8ec1f9a13ebc) and [onboarding new teams](https://blog.aragon.org/decentralizing-aragons-development-iii-onboarding-new-teams-32786cb805a5) along with [the Aragon Manifesto](https://blog.aragon.org/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03).

### Aragon One

<img src="design/logo/aragon_one/png/aragon-one-lineart-black-transparent.png" style="width:75%">

> [Aragon One](http://blog.aragon.one/introducing-aragon-one-b14dd804c5ce/) is one of the development teams working on Aragon. [Aragon One](https://aragon.one/) is a company that encompasses the foundational team working on the [Aragon Project](https://aragon.org). The company is currently established in Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as possible.

> We want Aragon One to be a small team, with high-bandwidth and trust between individuals. Keeping the team small will help us prevent many of the problems that arise when growing too much and too fast.

> Funding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to future teams that will be working on the project as well.

### Aragon DAC

<img src="design/logo/aragon_dac/Logo_ad.png" style="width:75%">

> The Aragon Association and [Giveth](https://giveth.io) are proud to announce the launch of Aragon DAC, a [Decentralized Altruistic Community](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4) on the Giveth platform that will work on building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective.

> The second team that will be working on the Aragon stack is a community focused effort led by the [Giveth community](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/mission/#giveth-is-a-decentralized-altruistic-community-dac-focused-on-using-blockchain-technology-for-good-to-make-the-world-a-better-place): the Aragon DAC will kick off with **two specific projects or 'Campaigns'**: one focusing purely on development, the other on experimentation with the Aragon stack. Experienced members of Giveth and Aragon One will help kickstart the Aragon DAC initiatives on a voluntary and part-time basis, with the clear goal of steering the DAC towards full independence.

> Funding for the community will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to [Aragon One](#aragon-one) and future teams that will be working on the project as well.

#### The Development Campaign
The Development Campaign is staffed with full-time and part-time people that create and tackle issues in the full Aragon Stack and is managed in a semi-decentralized way, while collaborating heavily with the Aragon One team and the R&D Campaign. This Campaign is spearheaded by Quazia, Social Coding Circle Lead at Giveth

#### The Community R&D Campaign
The Community R&D Campaign will focus on helping end users (=non-developers) experiment with using the Aragon Stack. #Dogfooding is the name of the game! This team is stewarded by Griff Green, Giveth's Governance Circle Lead
