# Aragon blog posts 2018

## August

### [**Aragon against censorship—Goodbye Medium, hello Ghost**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-against-censorship-goodbye-medium-hello-ghost/)
**Aragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium**

> On the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects. This effectively is censoring content by those trying to make the world a more free and open place to live.

### [**Join Aragon One**](https://blog.aragon.one/join-aragon-one-18ba965c0c0c)
**What is Aragon One working on, the positions we are currently hiring for and our community referral program**

> Aragon One, the first development team building Aragon
Aragon One is one of the development teams working on Aragon. It is part of the plan to decentralize Aragon’s development and governance (see Decentralizing Aragon’s development I, II, III).

## July

### [**Deploying and distributing Aragon Core**](https://blog.aragon.one/deploying-and-distributing-aragon-core-11e70cbc9b50)
**How to deploy and distribute a censorship-resistant upgradeable dApp**

> From the inception of the first versions of Aragon Core we took building a truly decentralized app very seriously. We decided that just using Ethereum as the settlement layer was not enough, because if a significant part of the infrastructure depended on centralized servers, we would quickly become a central point of failure that could be taken down.

### [**Manifesto-based organizations**](https://blog.aragon.one/manifesto-based-organizations-3c8ddcf6e666)
**How to fix soulless corporations from making everyone miserable**

> In the ideal world, every organization has a manifesto with its mission and values. Those values could be ranked, just like in the Aragon Manifesto.
>
> If an organization fails to follow their manifesto, users can point out the value they broke.

### [**Aragon Monthly Issue 06 is out!**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-monthly-issue-06-is-out-9797e238ae1)
**The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem**

> Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community.

### [**On Signaling and Social Pressure**](https://blog.aragon.one/on-signaling-and-social-pressure-3d97afbea355)
**How the Ethereum community could begin making meaningful signaling-based decisions**

> With the recent [Mainnet release of our Survey app](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5), I would like to propose the idea of Signaling DAOs as a way for stakeholder groups to self organize and produce clear signals. A Signaling DAO could be created by anyone, but in order for it to be impactful it should attempt to be representative of a relevant stakeholder group.

### [**Community Aggregation Theory 🐈**](https://blog.aragon.one/community-aggregation-theory-973a283c7226)
**Exploring how the valuation models fail to account for protocol commoditization**

> This post explores how the valuation models used to evaluate decentralized service protocols leveraging “work” tokens fail to account for protocol commoditization.

## June

### [**Aragon Core v0.5.1 Post Mortem — Part 1**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-core-v0-5-1-post-mortem-part-1-85b0897b9157)
**Summary of our first new development cycle**

> Our initial goal is to establish three two-week sprints. These sprints define a six week cycle. We established this goal as a starting point for the new product development process. The goal emerged from a discussion at our last offsite meeting in Switzerland. 0.5.1 started immediately after the offsite, on 16 April 2018.

### [**Opening applications for the Building DAOs video series**](https://blog.aragon.one/opening-applications-for-the-building-daos-video-series-81a17c92149f)
**Join us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum**

> With the recent launch of Aragon Core v0.5 we have seen a lot of renewed interest from people wanting to use Aragon to build their own decentralized organizations, or DAOs for short. To help kick off the process, we are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs.

## May

### [**Aragon launches Survey app on Mainnet**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5)
**First Aragon app launched on Ethereum Mainnet for community sentiment signaling**

> Today we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders.
>
> Survey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting & Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet.

### [**Aragon Network — On a path towards a digital jurisdiction**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-on-a-path-towards-a-digital-jurisdiction-752ccf4b9d5c)
**Launch of a new edition of the Aragon Network whitepaper and our research forum**

> As we have continued on our journey thinking about the challenges of creating a jurisdiction designed to be inclusive of DAOs and other pseudoanynomous entities, the economics and mechanisms in the original whitepaper have continued to evolve. Thus far, this progression has mostly been loose thoughts scattered among various chats and in-person conversations. But as development of the underlying infrastructure to support the network is maturing, the need for formalizing how the Aragon Network will operate grows.

### [**Aragon Q1 Transparency Report**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-q1-transparency-report-5ba9fc435ca6)
**A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q1 2018**

### [**Releasing the Aragon Developer Portal**](https://blog.aragon.one/releasing-the-aragon-developer-portal-237a8dbc8a48)
**A new command line tool for building Aragon apps, a straightforward tutorial, and reference documentation for all the building blocks**

> Today, we introduce tools and documentation for:
>
>    * aragonOS, the smart contract framework that provides upgradeability and governance solutions out-of-the-box
>    * Aragon UI, for a beautiful frontend experience
>    * aragon.js, in the middle connecting the two together

### [**Decentralizing Aragon’s development III: Onboarding new teams**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-iii-onboarding-new-teams-32786cb805a5)
**Incentivizing new teams to work on common Aragon infrastructure**

> We have already explained why we are decentralizing Aragon’s development, how we are decentralizing the legal vehicle that represents the project and introduced Aragon One, the first company contributing to Aragon’s development. In this post, we will lay out the strategy for onboarding more teams to work on core Aragon infrastructure.

### [**Introducing Aragon One**](https://blog.aragon.one/introducing-aragon-one-b14dd804c5ce)
**The first company contributing to Aragon’s development**

> Since we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper, we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development.
>
> Today, we are announcing the next step. We are announcing Aragon One.

### [**First community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey!**](https://blog.aragon.one/first-community-wide-aragon-feedback-survey-132df9547fbc)
**Tell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future**

> Now that we have released Aragon Core v0.5 — The Architect — it’s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven’t used the app yet!

**Five teams already funded and building is underway**

> Now, it’s time to introduce the first five projects that we’ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems.

### [**The Aragon Manifesto**](https://blog.aragon.one/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03)
**A pledge to fight for freedom**

> We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.

> Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.

### [**Decentralizing Aragon’s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-ii-minimum-viable-foundation-8ec1f9a13ebc)
**Reducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project**

> We have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon’s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project.

## April

### [**Aragon + Zug = ❤**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-zug-f4d7aaff15e1)
**Aragon’s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland**

> We first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum’s cofounder and Aragon’s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation’s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley — a vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein — with Zug at its epicenter.

> But Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let’s explore them.

**Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon**

> For the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams.

### [**Announcing Aragon Labs**](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae)
**Where research meets development**

> The goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need. Until we are confident that our tools and products have become stable and mature. That their development has reached a point that signifies them ready to secure valuable ecosystems such as the Aragon Network itself.
