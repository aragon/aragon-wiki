# **[Aragon Project blog](https://blog.aragon.org/)** posts in 2018

## October

### [**Aragon Nest: Third round of grants**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-nest-third-round-of-grants/)
**Five new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project.**

> The Nest grants program has introduced rounds one and two with the first teams. We now have five more teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project.

### [**What does governance mean**](https://blog.aragon.org/what-does-governance-mean/)
**An intro to the principles of governance.**

> Every collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual.
> 
> Instead, I want to describe a framework for thinking about the power dynamics associated with a governance process, and explore why its important to decentralize governance by establishing processes which prevent or mitigate the ability for power to concentrate and subvert the process at the expense of the organization as a whole.

### [**Deprecation notice for v0.5 Rinkeby DAOs**](https://blog.aragon.org/deprecation-notice-on-v0-5-rinkeby-daos/)
**Existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby to be deprecated after Oct. 28th.**

> Since the launch of Aragon Core v0.5 on the Rinkeby testnet this March, the Aragon One development team has been continually improving and battle testing the smart contracts that form the bedrock of over 2500 test organizations. However, as we progress toward a Mainnet launch, it's time to start bringing the latest technology to decentralized organizations.
> 
> To do this, on October 29, 2018, we will upgrade Aragon Core to version 0.6 on Rinkeby. This new version will include contracts that are not backwards-compatible with the existing v0.5 organizations. As part of the upgrade, we will also be deploying a new ENS registry that will reset the organization names available on aragonid.eth.
> 
> As a result, any existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby will be deprecated on Oct. 29, 2018.

### [**Aragon Nest Update—Evolution of the grants program**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-nest-update-evolution-of-the-grants-program/)
**The Nest program has been up and running for 7 months already. It's mature enough to make a high level analysis of the program so far and talk a bit about its future.**

> Nest is the grants program run by the Aragon Association (formerly the Aragon Foundation). The process is public and transparent. The Aragon One team was the only team managing it and deciding who and what gets funded up until now. Currently, the Aragon DAC, the new Aragon team, is also participating in the application process. The idea is that all the different Aragon teams will have a part to play in this grants program.

### [**Nest Team Interviews: Prysmatic Labs**](https://blog.aragon.org/nest-team-interviews-prysmatic-labs/)
**The third of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Prysmatic Labs who are building an Ethereum sharding client.**

> With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program.

### [**Announcing AraCon — The Aragon Conference**](https://blog.aragon.org/announcing-aracon-the-aragon-conference/)
**Today we’re announcing the first Aragon Conference — AraCon.**

> AraCon is the culmination of all the people supporting this and we couldn’t be happier to be inviting everyone to join us at this event.

## September

### [**Aragon Community Update #1**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-community-update-1/)
**Welcome to the first Aragon community update!**

> We’ve had a lot going on in the foreground and background of the community since I first joined as Community Lead last year and I’m excited to share some of what we’ve been up to.

### [**Aragon Monthly Issue 08 is out!**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-monthly-issue-08-is-out/)
**The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem**

> Aragon Monthly was introduced a while back in my post Bringing DAOs back — Aragon Monthly and has since been a monthly aggregated source of News and Articles for people interested in decentralized organizations and governance.

### [**Nest Team Interviews: Pando**](https://blog.aragon.org/nest-team-interviews-pando/)
**The second of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Pando who are also working on an open source incentivization app.**

> With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. Pando, when complete, will be a big step towards decentralization of development for all.

### [**Building a decentralized OS**](https://blog.aragon.org/building-a-decentralized-os/)
**How we built an Ethereum operating system that is upgradeable, secure and easy to use**

> The general concept goes as follows: You wouldn't want a Tetris app to own full control over your RAM. That would enable tampering with other apps or stealing precious information.
> 
> Similarly, you wouldn't want a CryptoKitties app to have full control over the funds of your DAO.
> 
> The role of the OS is to impose a rule system to not let that happen.

### [**Nest Team Interviews: That Planning Suite**](https://blog.aragon.org/nest-team-interviews-that-planning-suite/)
**The first one on our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is That Planning Suite who are working on an open source incentivization app.**

> With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. That Planning Suite was the first team accepted into the program and we're all thrilled to see their suite of apps becoming a part of the Aragon ecosystem.

### [**Aragon at ETHBerlin**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-at-ethberlin/)
**Hey, hey, heeey! This is Aragon and we are coming to ETHBerlin, Berlin!**

> We are so excited, so happy, really so thrilled to be Tier 5 – The Carlos Matos sponsor of the hackathon. Our mentors are coming, and they are coming in waves! Let me tell you, that we started 92 days ago with only one goal in mind. And right now, we are reaching that goal of being a part of the astonishing and inspiring ETHBerlin hackathon. And let me tell you that we are now actually putting two distinct bounty tracks up for hackers to #buidl on during the hackathon!

## August

### [**Aragon Labs Research Update #1**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-labs-research-update-1/)
**Latest news from the Aragon Research & Development department, Labs**

> Our research efforts are on exploring how to realize the lofty ambition of becoming a decentralized, digital jurisdiction. Both the scope and range of services a jurisdiction could offer to attract its constituency are vast and worth exploring. The single most crucial consideration right now is how it will be governed. With effective governance processes we can create new tools for the community. Tools to create new services, or replace or alter existing services, as required to make organizations more effective.

### [**Aragon Monthly Issue 07 is out!**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-q2-2018-transparency-report/)
**The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, decentralized governance and the Aragon ecosystem**

> Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community.

### [**Aragon Q2 2018 Transparency Report**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-q2-2018-transparency-report/)
**A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q2 2018**

> As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.

### [**Aragon Nest: Updates from the teams #1**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-nest-updates-from-the-teams-q2-2018/)
**Because accountability is key on funding new teams to work on decentralized ecosystems**

> One of the future plans for Nest is to start involving the community further so that it can participate in the decision making process regarding Nest's yearly budget and its governance... With those plans in mind we want to share with the community the progress of the first batch of the teams funded. The challenges they have faced, and the milestones they have accomplished. We plan to have the teams do these public updates every quarter. One of the key differentiators of the Nest program has always been transparency.

### [**Aragon Nest: Second round of grants**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-nest-second-round-of-grants/)
**Four new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project**

> Earlier the Nest grants program introduced the five first teams that had been awarded grants and told what they are working on. On this second update we announce the four new teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project.

### [**Aragon Q2 Development Update**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-q2-development-update/)
**Progress of development from the second quarter of 2018 and first round of audit results**

> Our developers have hard at work and here's a recap of the progress of development from the second quarter of 2018. Earlier we told that first round of audits was underway and today we are also publishing the results of that audit!

### [**Aragon DAC, a new community effort to foster Aragon's development led by Giveth**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-dac-a-new-community-effort-to-foster-aragons-development-led-by-giveth/)
**The Aragon Foundation and Giveth are proud to announce the launch of Aragon DAC, a Decentralized Altruistic Community on the Giveth platform that will work on building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective**

> You might know by now that Aragon is decentralizing its development: the first step was the introduction of Aragon One, the next step was announcing the onboarding of more teams to work on core infrastructure, in the near future. Well, the future is today!

### [**Aragon against censorship—Goodbye Medium, hello Ghost**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-against-censorship-goodbye-medium-hello-ghost/)
**Aragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium**

> On the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects. This effectively is censoring content by those trying to make the world a more free and open place to live.

## July

### [**Deploying and distributing Aragon Core**](https://blog.aragon.one/deploying-and-distributing-aragon-core-11e70cbc9b50)
**How to deploy and distribute a censorship-resistant upgradeable dApp**

> From the inception of the first versions of Aragon Core we took building a truly decentralized app very seriously. We decided that just using Ethereum as the settlement layer was not enough, because if a significant part of the infrastructure depended on centralized servers, we would quickly become a central point of failure that could be taken down.

### [**Manifesto-based organizations**](https://blog.aragon.one/manifesto-based-organizations-3c8ddcf6e666)
**How to fix soulless corporations from making everyone miserable**

> In the ideal world, every organization has a manifesto with its mission and values. Those values could be ranked, just like in the Aragon Manifesto.
>
> If an organization fails to follow their manifesto, users can point out the value they broke.

### [**Aragon Monthly Issue 06 is out!**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-monthly-issue-06-is-out-9797e238ae1)
**The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem**

> Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community.

### [**On Signaling and Social Pressure**](https://blog.aragon.one/on-signaling-and-social-pressure-3d97afbea355)
**How the Ethereum community could begin making meaningful signaling-based decisions**

> With the recent [Mainnet release of our Survey app](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5), I would like to propose the idea of Signaling DAOs as a way for stakeholder groups to self organize and produce clear signals. A Signaling DAO could be created by anyone, but in order for it to be impactful it should attempt to be representative of a relevant stakeholder group.

### [**Community Aggregation Theory 🐈**](https://blog.aragon.one/community-aggregation-theory-973a283c7226)
**Exploring how the valuation models fail to account for protocol commoditization**

> This post explores how the valuation models used to evaluate decentralized service protocols leveraging “work” tokens fail to account for protocol commoditization.

## June

### [**Aragon Core v0.5.1 Post Mortem — Part 1**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-core-v0-5-1-post-mortem-part-1-85b0897b9157)
**Summary of our first new development cycle**

> Our initial goal is to establish three two-week sprints. These sprints define a six week cycle. We established this goal as a starting point for the new product development process. The goal emerged from a discussion at our last offsite meeting in Switzerland. 0.5.1 started immediately after the offsite, on 16 April 2018.

### [**Opening applications for the Building DAOs video series**](https://blog.aragon.one/opening-applications-for-the-building-daos-video-series-81a17c92149f)
**Join us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum**

> With the recent launch of Aragon Core v0.5 we have seen a lot of renewed interest from people wanting to use Aragon to build their own decentralized organizations, or DAOs for short. To help kick off the process, we are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs.

## May

### [**Aragon launches Survey app on Mainnet**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5)
**First Aragon app launched on Ethereum Mainnet for community sentiment signaling**

> Today we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders.
>
> Survey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting & Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet.

### [**Aragon Network — On a path towards a digital jurisdiction**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-on-a-path-towards-a-digital-jurisdiction-752ccf4b9d5c)
**Launch of a new edition of the Aragon Network whitepaper and our research forum**

> As we have continued on our journey thinking about the challenges of creating a jurisdiction designed to be inclusive of DAOs and other pseudoanynomous entities, the economics and mechanisms in the original whitepaper have continued to evolve. Thus far, this progression has mostly been loose thoughts scattered among various chats and in-person conversations. But as development of the underlying infrastructure to support the network is maturing, the need for formalizing how the Aragon Network will operate grows.

### [**Aragon Q1 Transparency Report**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-q1-transparency-report-5ba9fc435ca6)
**A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q1 2018**

> As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project.

### [**Releasing the Aragon Developer Portal**](https://blog.aragon.one/releasing-the-aragon-developer-portal-237a8dbc8a48)
**A new command line tool for building Aragon apps, a straightforward tutorial, and reference documentation for all the building blocks**

> Today, we introduce tools and documentation for:
>
>    * aragonOS, the smart contract framework that provides upgradeability and governance solutions out-of-the-box
>    * Aragon UI, for a beautiful frontend experience
>    * aragon.js, in the middle connecting the two together

### [**Decentralizing Aragon’s development III: Onboarding new teams**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-iii-onboarding-new-teams-32786cb805a5)
**Incentivizing new teams to work on common Aragon infrastructure**

> We have already explained why we are decentralizing Aragon’s development, how we are decentralizing the legal vehicle that represents the project and introduced Aragon One, the first company contributing to Aragon’s development. In this post, we will lay out the strategy for onboarding more teams to work on core Aragon infrastructure.

### [**Introducing Aragon One**](https://blog.aragon.one/introducing-aragon-one-b14dd804c5ce)
**The first company contributing to Aragon’s development**

> Since we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper, we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development.
>
> Today, we are announcing the next step. We are announcing Aragon One.

### [**First community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey!**](https://blog.aragon.one/first-community-wide-aragon-feedback-survey-132df9547fbc)
**Tell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future**

> Now that we have released Aragon Core v0.5 — The Architect — it’s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven’t used the app yet!

**Five teams already funded and building is underway**

> Now, it’s time to introduce the first five projects that we’ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems.

### [**The Aragon Manifesto**](https://blog.aragon.one/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03)
**A pledge to fight for freedom**

> We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.

> Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.

### [**Decentralizing Aragon’s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-ii-minimum-viable-foundation-8ec1f9a13ebc)
**Reducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project**

> We have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon’s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project.

## April

### [**Aragon + Zug = ❤**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-zug-f4d7aaff15e1)
**Aragon’s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland**

> We first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum’s cofounder and Aragon’s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation’s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley — a vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein — with Zug at its epicenter.

> But Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let’s explore them.

**Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon**

> For the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams.

### [**Announcing Aragon Labs**](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae)
**Where research meets development**

> The goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need. Until we are confident that our tools and products have become stable and mature. That their development has reached a point that signifies them ready to secure valuable ecosystems such as the Aragon Network itself.
