# Aragon blog posts 2018

## May

### [**First community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey!**](https://blog.aragon.one/first-community-wide-aragon-feedback-survey-132df9547fbc)
**Tell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future**

> Now that we have released Aragon Core v0.5 — The Architect — it’s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven’t used the app yet! 

### [**Aragon Q1 Development Update**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-q1-development-update-b5525e9477c4)
**Progress of development from the first quarter of 2018**

> Releasing Aragon Core v0.5, The Architect, was the biggest development milestone during the first quarter of the year. 

### [**Aragon Nest: First awarded grants**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-nest-first-awarded-grants-29a2f3aa8d4a)
**Five teams already funded and building is underway**

> Now, it’s time to introduce the first five projects that we’ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems.

### [**The Aragon Manifesto**](https://blog.aragon.one/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03)
**A pledge to fight for freedom**

> We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.

> Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.

### [**Decentralizing Aragon’s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-ii-minimum-viable-foundation-8ec1f9a13ebc)
**Reducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project**

> We have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon’s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project.

## April

### [**Aragon + Zug = ❤**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-zug-f4d7aaff15e1)
**Aragon’s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland**

> We first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum’s cofounder and Aragon’s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation’s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley — a vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein — with Zug at its epicenter.

> But Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let’s explore them.

**Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon**

> For the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams.

### [**Announcing Aragon Labs**](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae)
**Where research meets development**

> The goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need. Until we are confident that our tools and products have become stable and mature. That their development has reached a point that signifies them ready to secure valuable ecosystems such as the Aragon Network itself.
