### [**Aragon comes back to the desktop**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-desktop/)
**Enhancing user experience while maximizing decentralization**

> Before being a web application, Aragon was born as a desktop app.

> The line between a web and a desktop app is blurring and will eventually become invisible. Yet, as of today, web apps are still limited, especially in our ecosystem since users need to run software not supported by browsers. For example an IPFS node with its native and fast implementation.

### [**Final details for Aragon Governance Proposal Vote #1**](https://blog.aragon.org/agp-vote-1/)
**Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) Vote #1, the first vote held under the recently ratified Aragon Governance Proposal Process, is scheduled to begin on January 24, 2019 at 00:00 UTC.**

> After a nearly two-month long period during which anyone could write and submit their own AGP for consideration - a period that was extended by one week following an emergency vote by the Aragon Association - a total of twelve proposals were submitted before the deadline. The Aragon Association reviewed and then voted to approve nine of those proposals, which will now move on to the official ballot to be voted on by ANT holders.

### [**Aragon Q4 Development Update**](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-q4-2018-development-update/)
**The progress of development from the fourth quarter of 2018.**

> The fourth quarter of 2018, spanning the months of October to December, was all about shipping, iterating, and then more shipping. The period also coincided with many breakthroughs on our research, from scalable on-chain voting to a crystallization of the first version of the Aragon Network. The results have helped guide the Aragon project’s product roadmap as well as the Flock proposals of Aragon One and the Aragon DAC.

### [**5 Reasons We Made AraCon Less Than $200**](https://blog.aragon.org/5-reasons-we-made-aracon-less-than-200/)
**AraCon is right around the corner.**

> One thing that was important to us when we set out to plan AraCon was that it didn’t turn into the expensive, four-figure ticket price that became common for crypto events over the last years.
