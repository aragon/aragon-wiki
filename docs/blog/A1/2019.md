> There are now over 500 Aragon organizations on mainnet and over 500 thousand dollars in ETH, ANT, DAI, and other assets held within organization vaults. The number of weekly active organizations has been increasing, going from 18 in January, to 45 in the last week in April. These numbers may seem modest, but it’s important to remember how early we still are. The realization of an economy dominated by blockchain-native organizations will take time. There will need to be experimentation and iteration along the way. Not to mention improvements to user experience and scalability of blockchain infrastructure.

### [**Aragon Network and Token Primer**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-and-token-primer/)
**The expectation is that as the Aragon Network DAO proves successful, more authority will be transferred away from the Aragon Association and into the hands of the Aragon Network. With this, ANT holders will gain more direct control of the Aragon project**

> Governance, whether of a company, state, or blockchain, fundamentally boils down to who is a stakeholder and the rights to which those stakeholders are entitled. If you fail to clearly define stakeholders, or fail to establish and enforce their rights, governance has likely already failed. Establishing stakeholders and their rights is not sufficient to have effective governance, but it is a necessary prerequisite.

### [**Aragon Network Vote #1 Review**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-vote-1-review/)
**This post will review what went well and what could be improved in Aragon Network Vote #1 (ANV-01).**

### [**Optimist off-chain data availability**](http://blog.aragon.one/optimistic-meets-off-chain-data-availability/)
**The optimist pattern allows for offloading heavy computation from the EVM**

>  However, in order to assume the result is legit, the input data to the function (and not just its hash) must be made publicly available so that any watcher can challenge the result on-chain in a non-interactive way.
