# Aragon Association ANT Policy

The Aragon Association (formerly Aragon Institution MTU a.k.a. "the Foundation") currently holds a [substantial amount](https://transparency.aragon.org/#/) of Aragon Network Tokens (ANT). As the governance token of the Aragon Network, ANT gives holders influence over how the Network will evolve over time.

When the Aragon Network is live, ANT held by the Network will not be able to be used for Network governance. To mimic these conditions, ANT held by the Association must not be used for Network governance either.

The Aragon Association Board of Directors is committed to the independence and autonomy of the Network and is therefore committed to **never** use ANT held by the Association for voting purposes. The Association will instead use its ANT as part of its incentive program and over time will transfer any remaining ANT to the Aragon Network.
