### Reporting

If the person who is harassing you is one of these admins, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as possible.

This code of conduct applies to Aragon community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Aragon community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community or team members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community.

At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the Aragon team.

### Enforcement
