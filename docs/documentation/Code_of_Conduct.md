## Our Responsibilities

Aragon team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Aragon team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Reporting

If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Aragon Chat admins `@light` or `@tatu` at [Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat). If the person who is harassing you is one of these admins, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as possible.

This code of conduct applies to Aragon community spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of Aragon community or team member outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community or team members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community.

In order to protect the Aragon team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the Aragon project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project or community include presenting themselves as Aragon community members, promoting the Aragon project as well as using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the Aragon team.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Aragon projects team at [Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The Aragon team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Aragon community members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Aragon team.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Aragon response team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Aragon project spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Aragon community members or the general public.
