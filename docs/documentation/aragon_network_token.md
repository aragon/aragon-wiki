# Aragon Network Token

## Overview

The Aragon Network Token (ticker symbol: ANT) is the native token of the Aragon Network. ANT is primarily used for the governance of the Aragon network. After the launch of the Aragon Network, it will also be possible to use ANT to collateralize agreements made by members of the Aragon Network. More information about the use of ANT in the Aragon Network can be found in the Aragon Network [whitepaper](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper).

## Initial token distribution

ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a [public token sale](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-the-aragon-network-token-sale-fe83fe36902c) that took place on [May 17, 2017](https://blog.aragon.one/final-token-sale-recap-1ac64ab7cfcd) - starting at Ethereum block 3723000 to be exact. Less than 100 blocks later, 275000 ETH worth of ANT were sold. Added together with ANT sold in the pre-sale, ANT granted to the Aragon Foundation, and ANT granted to founders and early contributors, the total initial supply of ANT after the token sale is 39609523.80952380954 ANT.

## Technical details

ANT is an ERC-20 token using the MiniMe standard. As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo [wrote](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-token-sale-technical-overview-9c2a4b910755) on the Aragon blog:

> We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime) is an ERC20 token created by the [Giveth](http://giveth.io/) team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there).
> 
> In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, we’re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations.
