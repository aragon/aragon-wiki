## **Executive Summary**

In February, Aragon asked us to do a code review for the aragonOS framework as well as the
Finance, Vault, Voting and Token Manager applications. We were very impressed with the
quality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in
the space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM
level. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability,
the access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines.

We spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity
issues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to
the code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a
clarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps
deployed if it was not corrected.

After our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they
worked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the
Aragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found.

The biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this
framework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly
recommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review
the code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend
that the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful
clarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of
security that this framework is designed to provide.

From the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed
first iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is
likely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired
usage of the DApp developers.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 About this review

The primary focus of this audit was to analyze the aragonOS contracts. We focused our efforts
on the Solidity contracts located at [https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v3.0.1/contracts](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v3.0.1/contracts)  
(bf434fc6a0720bff091a5d3abfc1190e5ec3f342)

For the aragon-apps we started at commit:  
[https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/3542fea317c641f801cef6ca365f52fda97c7323](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/3542fea317c641f801cef6ca365f52fda97c7323)

We concluded the audit by reviewing only the changes related to the initially found issues up to
[https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/be4522b264d2224279fbfe582f424f3c6c8d3c9b](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/be4522b264d2224279fbfe582f424f3c6c8d3c9b)
and  
[https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/05bf9e858e5234429f13bda22b7db9f79cba2f9e](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/05bf9e858e5234429f13bda22b7db9f79cba2f9e).

We assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as
we could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code.

**Scope: Solidity Contracts**

We critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand.

Solidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers.

**Out of Scope:**

As the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope:

- Actual business applications and real world scenarios.

- Documentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began)

- User interface and user experience.

- Deployment process.

- Even though the team went deep into solidity, we can not assume there are
zero errors in the solidity compiler.

### 1.2 Disclaimer

This document includes opinions and recommendations. All the opinions are our own and
independent of the Aragon team. We found issues in the Solidity code and general design of
system but that does not mean that we found all the issues.

### 1.4 Methodology

In order to provide a focused analysis on the provided smart contracts we undertook the
following steps:

- Understand the provided source code
- Define the primary and secondary objectives of the work, regarding the current
document deliverable and the kind of analysis to be done
- Read and analyze the previous security audits done
- Iterate over a frozen code base
    - internal analysis
    - share findings with the Aragon team
    - clarify possible misunderstandings with them
    - analyze their fixes, when applicable
- Consolidate, write and deliver the report

The following table describes the analysis performed to the current code, and the depth to
which each analysis has been done. When full, we feel the analysis is complete; when partial,
we feel further analysis would be beneficial, and when supplemental we feel that the task is not
in the scope of analysis but it has been also reviewed

Type | Description | Depth |
:----|:----|:----|
Standard code review | includes the common issues that are usually reviewed in all applications: code readability, specification matching, duplicated code, parameter checking, precondition assertions, code conventions, documentation, testing, code coverage, overflow/underflows, unused variables, bounds checking, etc... | Full |
Ethereum security specifics | Specific issues related to Solidity and the Ethereum execution environment, see Appendix A. | Full |
Standards | Standards fulfillment | Full |
Standard security review | Includes defining assets to be protected and checking [STRIDE attacks on the system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_(security)) | Partial |
Application logic | Check if code logic matches with the expected behaviour defined in the documentation | n/a |
(Crypto)Economics | Checks for (crypto)economic points of failure, and weakness in punish/incentivization systems | Supplemental |
Decentralization | Checks for centralized points of failure | Supplemental |
Simulation | Simulate the system | Supplemental |

Our findings are presented in the form V0##-XX, R00#-XX, and are specified in the Review  
Results section of the document, using the following pattern:

- Description
    - Description of the finding

- Location
    - Where is located (if applicable)

- Severity
    - The threats have been classified into five groups (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Comment) depending on the impact and the likelihood of the event. Sometimes it is really complicated to guess the likelihood or the impact of the finding. We use OWASP threat classification.

&nbsp; | Unknown Likelihood | Low Likelihood | Medium Likelihood | High Likelihood |
:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
High Impact | Medium | Medium | High | Critical |
Medium impact¬†| Medium | Low | Medium | High |
Low impact | Comment | Comment | Low | Medium |
Unknown Impact | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium |

- Status
    - ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù means that the reviewing team considers that the issue has been repaired.
    - ‚ÄúNot fixed‚Äù means that the issue is still present.

- Comments
    -   Our thoughts on the issue. The recommendations provided are not based on a detailed and deep analysis of the underlying problem, therefore they should be considered as a reference and not a definitive solution.

### 2.1 Critical Severity Issues
**[V001-CR] Delegate Executors can be killed by anybody**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/<br>evmscript/executors/Delegat<br>eScript.sol#L24](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/evmscript/executors/DelegateScript.sol#L24) | Critical | [os#250](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/250) | Fixed. Aragon team will temporarily remove this functionality in the next version. |

- Description

    - About
    [https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/evmscript/executors/DelegateScript.sol#L24](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/evmscript/executors/DelegateScript.sol#L24)
        - There is only one `DelegateScript` instance globally created in `EVMScriptRegistryFactory`. This DelegateScript has the public everybody callable method `execScript(bytes _script, bytes _input, address[] _blacklist)`. If the delegatecall-ed contract method contains a `SELFDESTRUCT`, the destructed contract will be the `EVMScriptRegistryFactory baseDel` instance which cannot be redeployed since it's not upgradable.

    - About
    [https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/250](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/250) fix
        - The fix, based on the assumption that a function that `SELFDESTRUCTs` called from a `delegatecall` never will return any data (`RETURNDATASIZE` is `0`), can be bypassed by doing an extra `delegatecall` jump, see the following exploit, based on current test mocks:

```
        contract DyingDelegatorHelper {
          function die() public returns (bool) {
            selfdestruct(0x0);
            return true;
          }
}

        contract DyingDelegator is DelegateScriptTarget {
          function exec() public returns (bool) {
            DyingDelegatorHelper helper = new DyingDelegatorHelper();
            address(helper).delegatecall(DyingDelegatorHelper(0).die.selector);
            return true;
          }
}
```
  - Comments
      - Consider limiting `DelegateScript` callers to the `EVMScriptRunner`.

### 2.2 High Severity Issues
**[V002-HI] Irrevocable permissions**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/<br>acl/ACL.sol#L121](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/acl/ACL.sol#L121) | High | [os#211](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/211) | Fixed |

- Description
      - By using require for permissions you can reach a situation where the permission depends on the parameters and you cannot revoke the permission because you don't check the specific parameters.
  - Comments
      - Should remove `require` permissions.

**[V003-HI] Function receiveApproval can exploit orgs/users with 0xFFF approval**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi<br>nance/contracts/Finance.sol#<br>L157](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/master/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol#L157) | High | [apps#83](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/issues/83) | Fixed. |

- Description
      - Currently, any user can call the `receiveApproval` function, moving another user‚Äôs tokens if they have given a 0xFFF approval to the org. Because this is really a hook called by the token contract, only the token should be able to call `receiveApproval`. It is up to the token to have the necessary protections.

  - Comments
    - Consider adding a `require(msg.sender == _token)`.

**[V004-HI] Possible overflow in voteTime**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/<br>aragon-apps/blob/master/a<br>pps/voting/contracts/Voting<br>.sol#L265](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/master/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol#L265) | High | [apps#187](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/issues/187) | Fixed |

- Description
    - The `voteTime` parameter is the seconds that a vote will be open for token holders. When checking `_isVoteOpen`, it is possible that `vote.startDate + voteTime` will overflow.

### 2.3 Medium Severity Issues
**[V005-MD] Cannot easily view permissions**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/<br>acl/ACL.sol](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/acl/ACL.sol) | Medium | [os#251](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/251) | Fixed |

- Description
    - For security and recovery situations a fast way to view permissions is necessary. Imagine a rogue employee starts moving funds. It would be good to be able to quickly see what other permissions that user has. Or if something strange is happening, being able to easily retrieve all permissions is helpful.

  - Comments
    - A `getPermissionParams` function would be very handy. Given entity, app, and role, tell me the parameters.

**[V006-MD] AppManager can upgrade a pinned app**

Location | Severity | Status |
:---|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/<br>kernel/Kernel.sol#L62](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol#L62) | Medium | Not fixed<br> Future improvement: aOS 4.0 |

- Description
    - There are two ways to get the `baseCode` for an app. Typically they would use `AppProxy.getCode()`. However if the proxy instance is registered with the kernel, you can fetch the app addr with `kernel.getApp()`. Thus if you register a `AppProxyPinned` instance with the kernel, then anywhere `kernel.getApp` is called to fetch the app address, it can be replaced with a new address by calling `kernel.setApp`. So the app isn't really pinned because it is replaceable.

**[V007-MD] CallScript buffer overflows**

- Description
    - A newVote can be created and automatically executed without taking a vote if the voting contract has not been initialized. The worry is that this odd feature could be exploited by attackers. Here is an example:

        1. A deployer deploys a contract
        2. Attacker creates a proposal to send all funds to address X. The quorum for this
        will be zero.
        3. The attacker votes for this proposal using another address so that it can be
        executed later. But also needs to vote for it in the same block as the vote
        deadline is also 0.
        4. The deployer initializes the contract. and gives it access to move funds from a
        vault.
        5. The attacker executes the vote that they have already passed and takes all the
        funds.

  - Comments
    - Have a `afterInitalize` modifier. Or use a factory to deploy.

### 2.4 Low Severity Issues
**[V009-LW] Issues if Solidity is upgraded**

Location | Severity | Status |
:---|:-|:---|
Example:<br>[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/<br>kernel/Kernel.sol#L11](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol#L11) | Low | Not Fixed<br>Documentation and tooling<br>issue. |

- Description
    - Even though the likelihood of this event is ‚Äúvery low‚Äù, we consider this issue of medium severity, to give an special attention to it.

    There are concerns about criteria changes in future solidity versions. The control that developers have on where the variables are stored is quite limited. Dependency on the multi-inheritance order on the definition of the class may variate the way state variables are stored.

    As an example, in Kernel, If we swap `KernelStorage` and `Initializable` it would break compatibility. This can easily happen in user defined apps and errors would be very difficult to detect causing all kinds of problems to those upgraded apps.

**[V010-LW] Previous repo releases are not fixable**

- Description
    - Concerning semantic version checks with `isValidBump` in APM Repo contract, if you release the version 3.0.0 after the 2.7.0, you will be not able to release a 2.7.1 patch.

  - Comments
    - May be a good idea if the `isValidBump` does not check the major version to allow patch fixing of previous ones.

**[V011-LW] ACL does not always return false when calling faulty ACLOracle**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/<br>aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/cont<br>racts/acl/ACL.sol#L261](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/acl/ACL.sol#L261) | Low | [os#252](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/issues/252) | Fixed |

- Description
    - When calling the ACL to check params, the `evalParam` function will always return `false` except when the `ACLOracle` is called which will potentially `revert`.

  - Comments
    - Using an assembly call to the `ACLOracle` and checking if the call succeeded or failed, will provide consistent handling of the params. May want to limit the `gas` provided to the `ACLOracle` as well.

**[V012-LW] Min period of 1 sec is too short**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi<br>nance/contracts/Finance.sol#<br>L119](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/master/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol#L119) | Low | [apps#240](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/240) | Fixed |

- Description
    - Min period of 1 sec for finance purposes makes no sense and it is possible to get into race conditions where a payment can not be made (due to the fact that you can only advance 20 periods per tx).

  - Comments
    - A min period of 1 day should be more than enough.

**[V013-LW] _reference is lost for a single payment**

Location | Severity | Issue | Status |
:---|:-|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi<br>nance/contracts/Finance.sol#<br>L220](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/master/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol#L220) | Low | [apps#219](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/219) | Fixed |

- Description
    - For a single payment in Finance app, you lose the `_reference` param.

    - Consider passing `_reference` to `_makePaymentTransaction` so the `_reference` is logged.

**[V014-LW] Race condition exists for payment recipients**

Location | Severity | Status |
:---|:-|:---|
[https://github.com/aragon/ara<br>gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi<br>nance/contracts/Finance.sol](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/master/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol) | Low | Not Fixed<br>No action will be taken.<br>Inherent ethereum flaw. |

- Description
    - If an organization using the Finance app owes more money out to receivers than it has, then receivers may begin racing each other hoping to get to any funds first as soon as they are available using the `receiverExecutePayment` function.

- Comments
    - Avoiding these kinds of races can be done by defining and implementing a better policy for payments when there is not enough money. Maybe prioritising older receivers or the ones with more reputation. Or may be allowing only to withdraw a portion of the funds. Any of these solutions may require a large development effort for something that may be complex and not worthy. So keeping the code as is, is probably the best decision at this stage, but users of this contract should be aware of this flaw.

**[V015-LW] Forward is too permissive**

Location | Severity | Status |
:---|:-|:---|

- Description
    - There are some great use cases for forwarding evm script functions. But this functionality should not be included as a general default with the TokenManager. It violates the single responsibility principle. It allows a function to return very different outputs.

- Comments
    - This functionality might be better placed outside the TokenManager in a contract specifically designed for the specific use cases it is intended for. Creating multiple instances of employees or IDs are two examples.

**[V016-LW] Should not permit anything if no Kernel or ACL is defined**

- Description
    - The Kernel and ACL are central to the operation of Aragon apps and so apps should be able to expect that they are defined. If the Kernel or ACL are not defined, then nothing should be allowed.

- Comments
    - Aragon‚Äôs argument about this issue is that an application should be able to run in standalone mode (Without an ACL defined). This seems a little dangerous (but not an issue by itself) since this permits any operation when this variable is set to zero (the initial value). In any case, this should be very well documented in the code and in the usage handbook.

- Description
    - If `regFactory` is provided, then `initialRoot` is set to `this`. `this` is then passed to `dao.initialize` which will grant the create permissions role to the factory contract.

:---|:-|:-|:---|
Anywhere a delegate proxy is<br>used | Comment | [OS#281](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/281) | Fixed (with new functionality that may need deeper review) |

- Comment
    - Send or transfer only permits 2300 gas but delegate proxy requires 10000 + execution costs. This means that you can not use the re-entrancy safe `transfer` and `send` methods provided by solidity to call an AragonApp. You would need to manually limit the gas with `vault.call.gas(16000).value(msg.value)()`.

    This issue, has been fixed recently in [https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/281](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/281) . Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality.

    The way it has been solved is by always accepting `send` and `transfer` calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism.

    This mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the `eth_estimateGas` function.


    Please, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed.

    - Related to V037-CM, there are a few permissions that are critical to the operation of the DAO. If these permissions fall into the wrong hands, they can break the entire DAO and any apps that share an ACL/Kernel. Sometimes these permissions are given to Apps within the DAO. A bug in 1 of these ‚Äúprivileged apps‚Äù can affect the entire DAO. Consider deploying Apps that are granted powerful permissions with a separate kernel, when possible, in order to provide some sandboxing.

**[V038-CM] Cache variables are in AragonApp‚Äôs storage**

- Comment
    - `DeployDelegateScript` contains a storage variable `cache` calculated from indexed storage slot `0`. Contracts implementing `EVMScriptRunner` (AragonApp) make a `delegatecall` to the scriptExecutor. When this `scriptExecutor` is the `DeployDelegateScript` executor this `cache` variable will potentially conflict with the calling contracts storage in slot `0`, thus potentially leading to storage corruption and unexpected state.

    With the current AragonStorage layout, there is no conflict because cache is a mapping and thus stored in slot `keccak256(‚Äò0‚Äô . index)` and the first storage variable in AragonStorage is `IKernel` and stored in slot `0`.

    - Use a 2 step process to change permission manager because changing the permission manager for the CREATE_PERMISSION_ROLE on the ACL itself is critical . For an example, see how owner is set here:

    - This should be passed the `spender`, but currently `spender == msg.sender`. Requesting an allowance should be for another entity to spend on your behalf. There is no need to `requestAllowance` for yourself, as you can just execute the `transfer`. When accepting `spender` as a param, this should be passed to `authP` as well.

    - In Finance app, `executePayment` should only return if payments are complete and there are no more pending payments. Currently, `executePayment` will pay all payments owed (payments can repeat).

- Description
    - There are 2 `hasPermission` functions in the `ACL`. One uses `bytes` for the `_how` param and the other uses `uint[]` for the `_how` param. In the `AragonApp` contract, `canPerform` converts from `uint[] -> bytes`. Then it is converted from `bytes -> uint[]` in the `ACL`.

- Comments
    - This is not an issue, but we keep this comment here because the cast in assembly is a little strange to read and because we believe that using the same type of data would make the code more consistent.

- Comment
    - In TokenManager app, `vestedTokens` should use safe math on return.  
In TokenManager app, use safe math for `isBalanceIncreaseAllowed` function.

## Appendix A. Security checks

### Assets

Considered as threat targets, smart contracts and user interface application logic should enforce using the underlying Ethereum technology to guarantee the self-protection and non-by-passability of the access controls for the following assets:

&nbsp; | &nbsp; |
:----|:----|
ETH | Stored/transferred ether asserts |
TOKEN | Stored/transferred token asserts (like ERC20) |
ACL | Deployed permissions |
Upgradability | Components (smartcontracts) upgradeability |
Core | Isolation Applications are not allowed to modify core data |
App | Isolation Applications are not allowed to modify data from other applications, only explicit communication channels can be used to share information between them. |

### Threat Agents

We use the following categories to understand who might attack the smart contracts:

&nbsp; | &nbsp; |
:----|:----|
Accidental Discovery | An ordinary user stumbles across a functional mistake in your application, just using a web browser, and gains access to privileged information or functionality. |
Privileged account mistake | A mistake (e.g. client library failures or fat finger errors) performed from an account that has special privileges on the smart contracts. |
Automated Malware | Programs or scripts, which are searching for known vulnerabilities, and then report them back to a central collection site. |
The Curious Attacker | A security researcher or ordinary user, who notices something wrong with the application, and decides to pursue further.
Script Kiddies | Common renegades, seeking to compromise or deface applications for collateral gain, notoriety, or a political agenda. |
The Motivated Attacker | Potentially, a disgruntled staff member with inside knowledge or a paid professional attacker. |
Whales | Big economic agents abusing blockchain economic models for financial gain. |
Miners | Miners abusing blockchain protocols for financial gain. |
Big Organizations | Highly trained professionals and criminals cracking or abusing blockchain smart contracts and protocols for financial gain, reputation destruction or geopolitical cyber warfare. |

### Operational Environment

We use the following operative scenarios when analyzing threats:

&nbsp; | &nbsp; |
:----|:----|
Normal operation | Ethereum ecosystem is stable |
Network congestion | High amount of pending transactions makes a Ethereum network congestion |
High volatility | ETH/$ price is having a high volatility |
Fork | A contentious fork of Ethereum that produces 2 seperate networks. |
Unexpected fatal bug / global settlement | An unexpected critical bug is found on the smart contracts |
Subsystems failure | Auxiliary subsystems (e.g. oracles) fails |
Operators failure | Smart contract operators fails or delays the execution |
Whale attacks | Economic whales gone wild |
