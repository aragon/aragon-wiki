### Aragon's licenses

When deciding about what would be the best open source licenses under which release components of the Aragon project, it was important that those licenses would empower and give total freedom to those who seek to improve the software and contribute it back to the community, without allowing big corporates or other for-profit entities to benefit from it without giving back. This is the reasoning behind these choices.
