Empowering Voluntary Communities
By John Light

Up until now, communities have been limited in their ability to remain autonomous and in control of their destiny.

Third parties and central authorities both inside and outside of communities have persistently tried to force their way into the relationships between members of communities.

Banks, charismatic leaders, governments… all have made enticing offers and promises of security to protect the community’s interests. And all have at one time or another broken these promises and violated trust.

With the advent of bitcoin we were given a way to disintermediate trusted third parties and eliminate the need for central control of digital money.

Now with platforms like ethereum we are seeing the rise of a new kind of organization free of centralized control: the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO for short.

Communities used to have to trust a bank to protect their shared assets, leaders to govern those assets, and governments to resolve disputes and enforce judgments. 

DAOs now make it possible for a community to have direct control of their shared assets using smart contracts enforced by a decentralized network of computers.

No central authorities required.

Let’s look at how this works in practice.

First, a member of the community will create a DAO representing the community. They will use an app to easily translate the governance rules of the community into computer code and deploy the code onto a smart contract network like ethereum.

Next, the creator of the DAO will add the members of their community to the DAO. Each member now holds a token (or tokens) representing their stake in the community.

With power in the organization now held in the hands of the community members, the shared assets of the community can be transferred to the DAO and governed by the rules set by the community.

Whenever the assets of the community need to be transferred, for example to pay employees or fund a community project, community members can use their tokens to vote directly to approve or decline the transfer and the outcome of the vote is executed exactly as the rules of the DAO specify.

If the community chooses to delegate their power to a smaller group of administrators, they can vote to upgrade the governance rules of their DAO and give the admins the limited power they need to carry out day to day activities on behalf of community members. Then if the community decides to withdraw power from the admins for any reason, they can vote again to withdraw that power. The members are always in full control of their community.

If there is a dispute between the members of a DAO or between the DAO and outside individuals or organizations, smart contracts can once again be used to resolve the disputes and execute judgment. An arbitration clause can be added to each contract that enables all parties to the contract to create a dispute that is resolved by an agreed upon arbitrator or decentralized court. And collateral can be used to limit losses by injured parties to a dispute.

To some this might sound like science fiction. And to some degree, today it still is. At Aragon we are working to make this sci-fi vision a reality. We want to empower communities to take control of their destiny and break free of central authorities. And we want to provide a safe mechanism for resolving disputes outside the inflexible legal systems run by monopoly jurisdictions in the physical world.

A golden age of decentralized organizations and voluntary communities is upon us. With the right tools, an appetite for experimentation, and a culture that believes in the virtues of individual liberty and community autonomy, we can ensure that this golden age lasts long into the future, opening up new opportunities for collaboration and exchange on a global scale.
