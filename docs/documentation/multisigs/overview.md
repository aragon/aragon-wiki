# Aragon Multisig structure

Having a good multisig structure is important for security, ANT holders' trust and ensuring the project can and will do everything as planned.

The Aragon sale will feature two multisigs:

- The Aragon Foundation Multisig (Aragon core developers). [Read more](foundation.md).
- The Community Multisig. [Read more](community.md).

Both use Gnosis Multisig at commit [25fba5](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis-contracts/blob/25fba563d95bbc8361c7de75801c38ce368cab85/contracts/solidity/Wallets/MultiSigWallet.sol) which was independently audited. Aragon multisigs were compiled using Solidity v0.4.8 with optimization disabled.
