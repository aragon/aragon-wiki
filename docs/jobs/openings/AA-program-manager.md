# Program Manager - Aragon Association

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that [decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems](https://blog.aragon.org/decentralized-organizations-can-solve-the-worlds-worst-problems-840db6255d12/).

The Aragon Association is a non-profit that oversees the development of the Aragon Project. It's formed by a very small and close-knit team distributed around the world, who cares a lot about the future of decentralized organizations. 

We're looking for a Program Manager to help us coordinate and communicate our grants program. Our Program Manager will impact the growth of the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems by enabling the development of infrastructure and tools.
