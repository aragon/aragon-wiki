# Solidity/EVM Engineer opening at Aragon One

We are looking for an Ethereum expert to work with us on [Aragon client](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-intro.html) and the upcoming [Aragon Network](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper).

### Requirements

- **Expert understanding** of Ethereum and the inner workings of the EVM.
- Provable ability to ship **high quality, well crafted code** running on Ethereum.
- Strong **unit testing** culture.
- Being passionate about **decentralization** (having some concerns is totally fine, we all do).
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for **time self-management** (We are focus-driven work, not hours-driven).

### Good to have

- Interest and knowledge in **cryptoeconomics**.
- Experience contributing or managing **open source projects**.
- Very good **written communication** skills.

### How to apply

Write the contract component of a new Aragon App that either improves upon one of our current [apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps) or is an entirely new use case that you think will wow us. The final contract should be deployable to the EVM (ignoring gas costs) and published to GitHub (public or private). Send us the link to the repo plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Solidity opening application`.
