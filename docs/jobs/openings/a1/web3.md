Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world’s worst problems.

We’re looking for a Web3 Developer to help us bridge smart contracts to a frontend. Internally, we call this position "Glue". Our Web3 Developer is ideally not only a Javascript expert but also a decentralization evangelist—someone who enjoys researching and testing new Web3 technologies.

### Responsibilities

- Take ownership of the development and maintenance of [aragon.js](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js), the JavaScript interface between smart contracts and the native web experience.
- Research and experiment with new Web3 technologies, including but not limited to [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), [Parity's 007 Bonds](https://github.com/paritytech/oo7-parity), and [eth.js](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs).
- Assist with Web3-related development when needed.

### Requirements

- Track record working with Javascript environments.
- Expert understanding on ES6/ES7, client-side storage, resource optimization, RxJS, service workers, and functional programming and Redux / Elm-inspired architectures.
- Proven ability to ship quality, well-crafted code within tight deadlines.
- Being passionate about open source and decentralization.
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management. We work focus-driven, not hours-driven.

### Good to have

- Previous experience contributing or managing open source projects.
- Previous experience working remotely.
- Very good written communication skills.

### How to apply

- Write an email with the following attachments plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Web3 Dev opening application`.
- Please send along your GitHub profile. 
- Bonus: Why did Aragon catch your attention? Which challenges within the crypto space are you more interested in?
