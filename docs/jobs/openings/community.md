- Being passionate about **decentralization** (having some concerns is totally fine, we all do).
- You have at minimum some **basic understanding of how Ethereum and DApps work**, that would make the job a lot easier, you can get a deeper knowledge on the job, but already having the basic knowledge would go a long way.
