## Web3 Developer Opening at Aragon

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world’s worst problems.

We’re looking for a Web3 Developer to help us consolidate smart contracts with a frontend, we call this position The Glue. Our Web 3 Developer must not only be a Javascript rockstar but also a decentralization evangelist, someone who enjoys researching and testing new Web3 technologies.

### Responsibilities

- Take ownership of the development and maintenance of [aragon.js](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js), the JavaScript library between smart contracts and the native web experience.
- Research and experiment with new Web3 technologies, including but not limited to [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) and [Parity systems](https://github.com/paritytech).
- Assist on smart contract and frontend development when needed.
- Help create developer tools and technical documentation.

### Requirements

- Track record working with Javascript environments.
- Expert understanding on ES6/ES7, React, client-side storage, resource optimization, CSS, using processors such as LESS or SASS, RxJS, service workers, and device APIs.
- Proven ability to ship quality, well-crafted code within tight deadlines.
- Being passionate about open source and decentralization.
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management. We work focus-driven, not hours-driven.

### Good to have

- Previous experience contributing or managing open source projects.
- Previous experience working remotely.
- Very good written communication skills.

### How to apply

- Write an email with the following attachments plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Web3 Developer Dev opening application`.
