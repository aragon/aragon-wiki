# Web3 Developer opening at Aragon One

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world’s worst problems.

We’re looking for a Web3 Developer to help us bridge smart contracts to a frontend. Internally, we call this position "Glue". Our Web3 Developer is ideally not only a Javascript expert but also a decentralization evangelist—someone who enjoys researching and testing new Web3 technologies.

### Responsibilities

- Take ownership of the development and maintenance of [aragonAPI](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js), the JavaScript interface between smart contracts and the native web experience.
- Research and experiment with new Web3 technologies, including but not limited to [Web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/), [Parity's 007 Bonds](https://github.com/paritytech/oo7-parity), and [eth.js](https://github.com/ethjs/ethjs).
- Assist with Web3-related development when needed.

### Requirements

- Track record working with Javascript environments.
- Expert understanding on ES6/ES7, client-side storage, resource optimization, RxJS, service workers, and functional programming and Redux / Elm-inspired architectures.
- Proven ability to ship quality, well-crafted code within tight deadlines.
- Being passionate about open source and decentralization.
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management. We work focus-driven, not hours-driven.

### Good to have

- Previous experience contributing or managing open source projects.
- Previous experience working remotely.
- Very good written communication skills.

### How to apply

- Write an email with the following attachments plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Web3 Dev opening application`.
- Please send along your GitHub profile.
- Bonus: Why did Aragon catch your attention? Which challenges within the crypto space are you more interested in?
