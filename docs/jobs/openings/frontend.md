## Frontend/Web3 Developer opening at Aragon

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems.

We're looking for a Frontend Developer to work with us on the [Aragon Labs](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae), [Aragon Core app](https://github.com/aragon/aragon), and [aragonOS](http://wiki.aragon.one/documentation/aragonOS/). Our Frontend Developer must not only be a frontend and web3 wizard but also a nonconformist. That means that our ideal candidate is not only a respected engineer but also a decentralization advocate.

### Responsibilities

- Develop the frontend for [Aragon Labs](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae), [Aragon Core](https://aragon.one/core) app and [aragonOS’ interfaces](https://aragon.one/os).
- Work with our Design Lead to transform ideas and designs into modern, clean, and readable code.
- Research, develop, test and implement features on web applications built with modern technologies.
- Collaborate with the product team to define new product features.

### Requirements

- Expert understanding on: ES6/ES7, React, React Native and Electron, Client-side storage, Resource optimization, CSS, using preprocessors such as LESS or SASS, RxJS, Service Workers, Animations and Device APIs.
- Experience working with Web3 technologies.
- Proven ability to ship quality, well crafted code within tight deadlines.
- Being passionate about open source and decentralization.
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management. We work focus-driven, not hours-driven.

### Good to have

- Previous experience contributing or managing open source projects.
- Previous experience working remotely.
- Very good written communication skills.
- Attention to UX/UI design.

### How to apply

- Write an email with the following attachments plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Frontend Dev opening application`.
- Please send along your GitHub profile. Since we are open source only, we require applicants for developer positions to have a very active and healthy GitHub profile.
- Bonus: Why did Aragon caught your attention? Which challenge within the crypto space are you more interested in?
- Please send the following challenge completed:

- The app will be loaded in a browser with MetaMask.
- Feel free to interpret the requirements in any way that you think could be interesting.
