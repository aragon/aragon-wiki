# Frontend Developer opening at Aragon One

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project [fighting for the freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjIWmiAidw) to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems.

We're looking for a Frontend Developer to work with us on the [Aragon Labs](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae), [Aragon client](https://github.com/aragon/aragon), and [aragonOS](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-intro.html). Our Frontend Developer must not only be a frontend and web3 expert but also a nonconformist. That means that our ideal candidate is not only a respected engineer but also a decentralization advocate.

### Responsibilities

- Develop, ship, and maintain quality frontends for the [Aragon Labs](https://blog.aragon.one/announcing-aragon-labs-a679693429ae) and [Aragon client](https://github.com/aragon/aragon) app projects, working closely with our [UI toolkit](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonui-intro.html).
- Work with our Design Lead to transform ideas and designs into modern, clean, and readable code.
- Research, develop, test and implement features on web applications built with modern technologies.
- Collaborate with the product team to define new product features.

### Requirements

- Expert understanding of: Modern JavaScript (ES6+) and Web APIs, CSS, React (Web and Native), resource optimization, development tools.
- Experience working with Web3 technologies.
- Proven ability to ship quality, well-crafted code within tight deadlines.
- Being passionate about open source and decentralization.
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management. We work focus-driven, not hours-driven.

### Good to have

- Previous experience contributing or managing open source projects.
- Previous experience working remotely.
- Very good written communication skills.
- Attention to UX/UI design.

- Write an email with the following attachments plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Frontend Dev opening application`.
- Please send along your GitHub profile. Since we are open source only, we require applicants for developer positions to have a very active and healthy GitHub profile.
- Bonus: Why did Aragon catch your attention? Which challenge within the crypto space are you more interested in?
