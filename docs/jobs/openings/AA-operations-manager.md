# Operations Manager - Aragon Association

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project fighting for the freedom to organize. We believe that [decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems](https://blog.aragon.org/decentralized-organizations-can-solve-the-worlds-worst-problems-840db6255d12/).

The Aragon Association is a non-profit that oversees the development of the Aragon Project. It's formed by a very small and close-knit team distributed around the world, who cares a lot about the future of decentralized organizations. 

We're now looking for an Operations Manager, to help us optimize the financial and operational structure of the Aragon Association,and own the operations needed in running the Association in a smooth way.

### Responsibilities

*   Set up and manage the accounting processes for the activities of the association
*   Track and plan team expenses, generate expenses reports and handle reimbursements
*   Handle payroll and human resources operations
*   Act as the liaison with third party service providers, such as law firms, accountants and auditors
*   Handle logistics and other operational tasks as needed
*   Provide support to the team and enhance internal processes in other areas as needed or of interest
*   Be in charge of special projects

### Who is this job perfect for?

This is the perfect job for someone with a few years of experience in a small team, that would like to grow into a role with more responsibilities that gives the freedom and ability to handle tasks in many different areas and have a real impact in the trajectory of the Aragon ecosystem.

If your goal is to be a great executioner, future COO or CEO, this is the perfect learning ground.

Regardless of the above, if you think you'd be a great fit for this position, we highly suggest applying - the worst is that it turns out not to be a fit for you.


### Useful Experience

We think that anyone can learn anything, and thus value personal traits more than work experience, but any of the following would probably be helpful to you

*   Previous accounting experience
*   Previous experience in a startup or very small team
*   Experience in hiring and managing other people

### Location

*   Ideally located in, or willing to relocate to, Zug or anywhere else in Switzerland. But open to exceptions.

### How to apply

*   Email _[sb@aragon.org](mailto:sb@aragon.org)_, with what you'd like to see submitted if you were the hiring manager for this role
