# Job Openings

Aragon is an open source, decentralized, project fighting for the freedom to organize.

We believe that **decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems**, read more about it [here](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralized-organizations-can-solve-the-worlds-worst-problems-840db6255d12).

## Teams

> _To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Foundation to form a company of core developers. Everyone currently employed by the Foundation will become employees of a new company funded by the Foundation. That way, **we level the playing field for other teams to join the core development of the project**._

With [Aragon Nest](https://github.com/aragon/nest) we are already supporting projects that are not necessarily sustainable by themselves yet, but are crucial to the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems.

**We will expand the scope of Nest to start funding alternative teams** that have a desire to work on the [**Aragon Core client**](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started.html), [**aragonOS**](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref.html) and on [**Aragon Apps**](../dev/apps/).

Since we released the first version of the [Aragon whitepaper](../documentation/whitepaper.md), we knew that it was important to **split the non-profit entity** overseeing the project [**from the actual companies or teams working on its development**](https://blog.aragon.one/the-path-to-mainstream-decentralized-organizations-d95a89d3cac4).

For more context, we've published three blog posts about why it makes sense to [decentralize Aragon's development](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-5062fd6d135d), [the steps forward for the non-profit entity](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-ii-minimum-viable-foundation-8ec1f9a13ebc) and [**onboarding new teams**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-iii-onboarding-new-teams-32786cb805a5) along with [the Aragon Manifesto](https://blog.aragon.one/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03).

## Aragon One

> Aragon One is a company that encompasses the foundational team working on the Aragon project. The company is currently established in Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as possible.

> Funding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to future teams that will be working on the project as well.

### Process 🤓

We don't think talent is geographically centralized and people are magically available at our disposal. We have a continuous hiring process where jobs are open worldwide until we find the right person **for Aragon and each role**. We built a hiring process where we're not the only ones testing but you also get to actively know us:

1. **Submit Application**
We'll review your application and we may ask you for more info.
2. **Initial Interview**
If there's a potential fit, we'll schedule a call.
3. **Challenge**
We'll ask you to solve a real problem.
4. **Meet the team**
If we liked your submission, you'll chat with Luis, Jorge and/or Chris.
6. **Offer**
If we see a full match, we'll extend you an offer.
7. **Trial**
Since we're remote, if there's consensus, we'll work in person for a week before taking the final decision.
