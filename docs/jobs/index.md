## Culture 🌍

- We empower **deep work** sessions, minimizing bureaucracy and leaving Monday for all meetings and internal calls.
- We encourage team members to spend a substantial part of their paid work time on unrelated blockchain open source projects to speed up the development of the ecosystem.
- We are **open source only**.
- We are a technology company. Our focus is **product first**.


## Work conditions 🚀

- **Full time** commitment. Side projects and open source are accepted (and encouraged).
- Completely **remote** position, no relocation required.
- Very competitive compensation.
- You decide **how to allocate your salary in fiat, ETH or ANT**.
- Yearly bonus in ANT based on performance.
- We empower autonomous workers with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management.

- We really value people that have previously **contributed to the project** in a voluntary manner, or that are **community members**.
