    * CV/LinkedIn for other positions

* We really value people that have previously **contributed to the project** in a voluntary manner, or that are **community members**.

More specific instructions for each position can be found in the openings.


## Process ü§ì

We don't think talent is geographically centralized and people are magically available at our disposal. We have a continuous hiring process where jobs are open worldwide until we find the right person **for Aragon and each role**. We built a hiring process where we're not the only ones testing but you also get to actively know us:

1. **Submit Application**
We'll review your application and we may ask you for more info.
2. **Initial Interview**
If there's a potential fit, we'll schedule a call.
3. **Challenge**
We'll ask you to solve a real problem.
4. **Meet the team**
If we liked your submission, you'll chat with Luis, Jorge and/or Chris.
6. **Offer**
If we see a full match, we'll extend you an offer.
7. **Trial**
Since we're remote, if there's consensus, we'll work in person for a week before taking the final decision.
