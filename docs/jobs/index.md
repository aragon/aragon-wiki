# Job Openings

Aragon is an open source, decentralized, project fighting for the freedom to organize.

We believe that **decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems**, read more about it [here](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralized-organizations-can-solve-the-worlds-worst-problems-840db6255d12).

## Teams

> _To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Association to form a company of core developers. Everyone currently employed by the Association will become employees of a new company funded by the Association. That way, **we level the playing field for other teams to join the core development of the project**._

With [Aragon Nest](https://github.com/aragon/nest) we are already supporting projects that are not necessarily sustainable by themselves yet, but are crucial to the Aragon and Ethereum ecosystems.

**We will expand the scope of Nest to start funding alternative teams** that have a desire to work on the [**Aragon client**](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/getting-started.html), [**aragonOS**](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref.html) and on [**Aragon Apps**](../dev/apps/).

Since we released the first version of the [Aragon whitepaper](../documentation/whitepaper.md), we knew that it was important to **split the non-profit entity** overseeing the project [**from the actual companies or teams working on its development**](https://blog.aragon.one/the-path-to-mainstream-decentralized-organizations-d95a89d3cac4).

For more context, we've published three blog posts about why it makes sense to [decentralize Aragon's development](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-5062fd6d135d), [the steps forward for the non-profit entity](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-ii-minimum-viable-foundation-8ec1f9a13ebc) and [**onboarding new teams**](https://blog.aragon.one/decentralizing-aragons-development-iii-onboarding-new-teams-32786cb805a5) along with [the Aragon Manifesto](https://blog.aragon.one/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03).

## Aragon One

<img src="../design/logo/aragon_one/png/aragon-one-lineart-black-transparent.png" style="width:75%">

> Aragon One is a company that encompasses the foundational team working on the Aragon project. The company is currently established in Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as possible.

> Funding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to future teams that will be working on the project as well.

### Process 🤓

We don't think talent is geographically centralized and people are magically available at our disposal. We have a continuous hiring process where jobs are open worldwide until we find the right person **for Aragon and each role**. We built a hiring process where we're not the only ones testing but you also get to actively know us:

1. **Submit Application**
We'll review your application and we may ask you for more info.
2. **Initial Interview**
If there's a potential fit, we'll schedule a call.
3. **Challenge**
We'll ask you to solve a real problem.
4. **Meet the team**
If we liked your submission, you'll chat with Luis, Jorge and/or Chris.
6. **Offer**
If we see a full match, we'll extend you an offer.
7. **Trial**
Since we're remote, if there's consensus, we'll work in person for a week before taking the final decision.

## Aragon DAC

<img src="../design/logo/aragon_dac/Logo_ad.png" style="width:75%">

As part of the ongoing efforts to build out the Aragon infrastructure, the Aragon Association and Giveth are building the Aragon DAC, a Decentralized Altruistic Community run using the Giveth DApp building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective.  Read more about our formation [here](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-dac-a-new-community-effort-to-foster-aragons-development-led-by-giveth/).

We are currently building 2 teams that will work closely together. The first is the Community R&D Campaign that will help end-users (=non-developers) experiment with using the Aragon Stack. Second is a core dev team that will focus on developing the Aragon codebase, implementing features especially needed by the users. Both teams are advised by experienced members of Giveth and Aragon One teams and will work closely with each other.

We invite you to join us in building a better world!
