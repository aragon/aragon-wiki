## Some Media Mentions

### The Merkle
#### [What Is AragonOS?](https://themerkle.com/what-is-aragonos/)
> Although a lot of people readily dismiss altcoins these days, there are some interesting projects out there. The Aragon project is currently working on AragonOS, which introduces some major changes to smart contracts as we know them today. More specifically, smart contracts’ underlying architecture is in dire need of some upgrades. Introducing more flexibility and making it easier to extend the functionality of these contracts is well worth looking into.

### Venturebeat
#### [No CEO needed: These blockchain platforms will let ‘the crowd’ run startups](https://venturebeat.com/2017/12/03/no-ceo-needed-these-blockchain-platforms-will-let-the-crowd-run-startups/)
> Back in May, I wrote about the concept of DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations capable of running themselves thanks to blockchain technology — no CEO or C-Suite needed. At the time I was writing, there were a few people in the blockchain community testing out the idea but no strong efforts underway. That was six months ago.

> As anyone in the crypto space will tell you, six months is a really long time. Today, a market for DAO platforms is emerging, complete with teams, funding, development, and initial implementations.

#### [12 changes that could shake up the blockchain world in 2018](https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/01/12-changes-that-could-shake-up-the-blockchain-world-in-2018/)

#### [How The Token Model Is Changing Coding For The Better](http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/08/open-source-model/)
> For a long time free and open source software was a niche seen by many as a threat to major software developers and large corporations who wished to enforce stricter intellectual property rights. Although patents and intellectual property rights were originally designed to protect the rights of the creators, in coding this is often enforced to the detriment of the community at large.

> However, during the last decades, open source models were gaining popularity and had a loyal following particularly among Linux enthusiasts.

> Open source offers great benefits in the areas of cost, flexibility, freedom, security, and accountability. You can see how the code is developed, what it does, and why. Unlike closed proprietary software, code can be altered and extended by any developer.
