## Notes

Trying to define a migration path for releasing aragonOS 4
- All core apps will be updated
- Once the freeze is in place an audit will begin
- All contracts are now setup to use new storage structure (unstructured storage; slots start at 0)
- aragonOS 4 be incompatible with any current aragonOS 3 DAOs on Rinkeby
  - If everything is on testnet how risky is this?
  - Will prompts be sufficient to inform user base?
  - Github Issue: https://github.com/aragon/governance/issues/33

Permissions app:
- Currently read-only version on staging: http://aragon-staging.aragonpm.com/#/ngo.aragonid.eth/permissions
  - Appreciate testers
- Working on write version this week, will deploy later in the week or early next week

Bounties:
- We have somebody interested in helping with documentation
- Setup rate for targeted bounties
  - How many hours and how much per hour?
  - Would like to have two or more people review the rates to see if they’re appropriate
  - Flow for deciding:
    - Summary of task, and then let everyone estimate hours needed
    - Split UI into: Build components, unify components with mocked data, replaced mocked data with on chain data, add transaction sends (https://github.com/aragon/hack/issues/30)

Bountes : (lots of front end)
- TCR frontend: The smart contracts are ready and everything is very scoped, so this would just be opening up a milestone for building the TCR apps. It could even be multiple milestones, one for PLCR, one for Staking, one for the Curation app…
- Payroll frontend: The contracts are ready too, and even some part of the frontend has been implemented
