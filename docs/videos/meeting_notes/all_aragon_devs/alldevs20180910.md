Aragon-cli v5:

Permissions app:
- Ready for testing
- Bundled with the cli
- Review for any potential issues

aragonOS v4:
- Ready for the audit
- Add Jeremy and Arthur to Consensys audit report

Aragon.js:
- Maybe add a tag for issues assigned to the DAC?
- Arthur to review [AGP 19](https://github.com/aragon/governance/issues/28)

Aragon DAC:
- Started having consistent meetings
- Jeremy is working on a provider engine to allow DAOs transact with each other
- Daniel is still testing aragon.js (currently aragon-wrapper)
- Testing: what other repos need testing?
  - Front end? (jest/enzyme?) aragon ui and aragon client
  - Apm.js
  - aragon-cli
- Research zenhub/public kanban

EthBerlin:
- Ran a workshop/video on how to develop on Aragon
- Main issues were with the CLI and permissions app
- Not so many teams tried Aragon
- Walkthroughs/video tutorials for using Aragon
- Live peer videos arn’t necessarily available right now need to get updates
- Tooling and docs were ready; event organization was the failing element
- Would be good to focus attention on docs consistently instead of doing pre-event pushes

EthSF
- Get some Shwag to Jeremey

Aragon One:
- Release to main net prior DevCon (~30th October) 
- Will start sprint 1.3 focusing on the token manager
- AragonDAC will try to help with the release to mainnet
