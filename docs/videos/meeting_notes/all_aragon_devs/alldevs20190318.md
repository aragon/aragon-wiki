    - EthCC
    - Internal off-site
    - Quarterly planning
    - High level targets
- User adoption is low!
    - Scout dashboards are available to track some key metrics
    - Focus on adoption in the upcoming quarter

    - Contract updates (with app centre)
        - ERC20 Token compatibility
        - Plumbing and infrastructure related changes
- Advances in the court
    - Human readable description
    - Changes will be updated in forum
    - Should be open-sourced soon

Autark & OWL updates

- Implemented cypress for E2E testing
- Implementing the address badge component
- Technical spec for profile app
- Researching 3box implementation due to lack of signing capabilities
- Projects app contract bug from aragonOS upgrade (upper gas limit)
    - Temporarily pinned aragonOS to a lower version
    - Would be useful to know the max size of an Aragon app contract

Aragon CLI

- New version of the CLI released 5.5
- Two new commands
    - apm info
    - apm packages
- Documentation update regarding new features
    - How to publish
- Internal repo changes -> move to a mono-repo
- E2E testing

ConsenSys Diligence

- Supported AuthIO with their audit
- Preparing to audit upcoming PRs (apps #702 #710)
- Looking forward to getting more insights into the dev process

aragonCLI restructuring

- Currently “monolithic”
- How do we want to make it more extendible
- Oliver + Daniel to discuss this further and share insights at next All Devs

aragonAPI restructuring

- Tied to CLI (previous point)
- Oliver will send an invite to a call to discuss this tomorrow
- Relates to the aragonCLI restructuring topic

Apiary review (Pando)

- We’re almost done with smart contracts.
- In two weeks they should be done.
- Internal review could start
- The frontend should follow

Maximum AragonApp contract size

- Planning app is an example of a “maximalist” app.
- We monitor gas increases in aragonOS
- Planning (or projects?) app already reaches the 8 million gas limit
- Jorge suggested adding a test to ensure a basic contract inheriting from AragonApp does not exceed a certain amount of gas
- Brett will create an issue for this

Technical improvements to aragonOS for That Planning Suit

- To be discussed offline between Brett & Arthur

Identity providers

- It may be interesting to have a dropdown menu to select the recipient of a transfer for example.
    - The app should be responsible of rendering the labels besides of what the provider returns for an address.
    - We need to think how this will fit in every place we are dealing with an address.
- There may be some security implications on caching identities
    - @diligence team offered some help analyzing/discussing caching strategies
- Link to initial identity spec
    - [https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/251](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js/issues/251)

Determining how best to allocate dev work for overlapping initiatives (e.g. individual identity/rich profiles/organization identity)

- Yalda to schedule call with Luis on Home app
