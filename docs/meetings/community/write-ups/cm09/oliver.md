## Aragon Community Meeting 09 Write-Up for February

### Oliver - Glue

#### Events / Onboarding

##### Offsite
Spent a week with the Arafam at the Q1 offsite.

##### Trial week
Worked with Bingen, Jouni and Chris during their trial week.

##### Audits
Met with auditors and yanked out APM-specific logic to it's own library because of it, amongst oher things.

##### ETHDenver

Spent a week at ETHDenver helping people hack on Aragon. People built super exciting and cool stuff, and we learned a lot about the state of our tools and documentation, too! Can't wait to see what people will build in the future :)

#### Documentation

Put togeher some rough documentation for the following things (primarily because of ETHDenver):

- Aragon CLI
- aragon.js
- Created a rough "developer portal" (hack.aragon.one)

#### aragon.js

Released a few beta versions, each with their own things. Summarised:

- Transaction pathing works
- Reading state works
- Basic cache is implemented
- Basic support for notifications is implemented
- Listening for events has been implemented
- Some meta-changes (CI, crude documentation, bug fixes and shuffling some things around)

### Next

#### Aragon CLI

A lot of things have changed in aragonOS, so Aragon CLI has some pending work

- Should be compatible with permission escalation, since APM is now a DAO
- `playground` and `bootstrap` commands for better dev experience

#### aragon.js

- More tests, more stable API
- Better documentation

#### Product

- Launch 0.5

#### Events

- ScalingNOW in Barcelona
- EthCC in Paris
