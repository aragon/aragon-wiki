# Aragon client smart contracts bug bounty

A bug bounty for the smart contracts in the Aragon client is now live. We intend for hackers to look for smart contract vulnerabilities in our system that can lead to loss of funds or locked DAOs.

## Rewards

Vulnerability reports will be scored using the  [CVSS v3](https://www.first.org/cvss/) standard. The reward amounts for different types of vulnerabilities are:

!!! bug "**Critical** (CVSS 9.0 - 10.0)"
    $5,000 - $50,000

!!! danger "**Major** (CVSS 7.0 - 8.9)"
    $2,500 - $5,000

!!! fail "**Medium** (CVSS 4.0 - 6.9)"
    $1,000 - $2,500

!!! warning "**Low** (CVSS 1.0 - 3.9)"
    $500 - $1,000

Rewards will be awarded at the sole discretion of the Aragon Association. Quality of the report and reproduction instructions can impact the reward. Rewards are denominated in USD and will be paid out in ETH.

For this initial bug bounty program, there is a **maximum bounty pool of $250,000**.

The bug bounty program is ongoing and has ran since October 17th, 2018.

## Reporting

!!! note "Reporting a found vulnerability"
    Please responsibly disclose any findings to the development team. You may find instructions on how to do so in the [security overview page](../).

    Failure to do so will result in a finding being ineligible for any bounties.

## Out of scope

!!! question "What we consider out of scope for this bug bounty"
    - Side-effects of properly authenticated smart contract upgrades or contract upgrades that change the storage layout of a contract.
    - Revocation of permissions or completely changing how a DAO operates due to important permission being granted through the proper processes.
    - Any frontend applications or client-side code interacting with the contracts, as well as testing code.
    - Mismatch of the functionality of the contracts and outdated spec documents.

## Areas of interest

!!! tip "These are some examples of vulnerabilities that would be interesting"
    - Bypassing ACL rules to get unauthorized access to an app.
    - A user of an app performing an action that could freeze or lock the contract.
    - Being able to escalate permissions using the Voting app or Token Manager without a proper vote being successful.

## Eligibility

!!! success "Terms for eligible bounties"
    - Only unknown vulnerabilities will be awarded a bounty; in case of duplicate reports, the first report will be awarded the bounty.
    - Public disclosure of the vulnerability, before explicit consent from Aragon to do so, will make the vulnerability ineligible for a bounty.
    - Attempting to exploit the vulnerability in a public Ethereum network will also make it ineligible for a bounty.
