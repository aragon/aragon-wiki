# About the Aragon Association

The Aragon Association is a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland, and the legal steward of the Aragon project. 

The Association was founded in 2018 and is responsible for managing the funds raised in the [Aragon Network Token](../network/aragon_network_token.md) sale. The token sale funds were originally raised and managed by the [Aragon Insitution MTU](https://www.inforegister.ee/en/80416542-ARAGON-INSTITUTION-MTU), a non-profit entity based in Estonia, and later transferred to the Aragon Association when it was [decided](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-zug-f4d7aaff15e1/) by the Aragon Institution MTU Board of Directors that the Zug canton in Switzerland would be a more suitable jurisdiction.

The Association is led by [Executive Director Stefano Bernardi](https://blog.aragon.org/welcoming-stefano-to-the-aragon-association/) and overseen by a Board of Directors comprised of Aragon project co-founders [Luis Cuende](https://luisivan.net/) and [Jorge Izquierdo](http://izqui.me/).
