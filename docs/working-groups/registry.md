## Working Group Registry

### aragonSDK WG

We want to make the Aragon SDK a delightful developer experience. This is not necessarily limited to the CLI, but to all parts of the Aragon stack that target power users and developers, as opposed to users of the Aragon Client.

At the current time, however, our efforts are focused around the CLI to improve both developers' and power users' experiences.

**Offline discussions** occur in the [SDK-WG chat channel](https://aragon.chat/channel/wg-sdk).

**Stand ups** happen every Tuesday and Thursday; please join the SDK-WG chat to introduce yourself if you would like to join.

Larger discussions related to the CLI and its direction will also be held in the [Aragon All Devs bi-weekly meetings](https://wiki.aragon.org/all_aragon_devs/overview/).

### Nest WG

We believe the fate of humanity will be decided at the frontier of technological innovation. It is essential that this technology creates positive-sum value for all parties involved. In a globally connected world it is essential that people can connect, organize, share in value creation - anytime, anywhere, without borders or intermediaries. The Nest WG exists to help teams realize this dream on Aragon. 

Our main functions involve managing the NestDAO, evaluating proposals, and making funding decisions to support those proposals. More details on the Nest program can be found on the [Nest repo README](https://github.com/aragon/nest/).

We meet every 2 weeks we have calls to discuss Nest proposals and make funding decisions. If you'd like to get involved or have questions please drop into our [#wg-nest Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat/channel/wg-nest).

### Strategy WG

This WG focuses on strategic initiatives to sustain and grow the Aragon Network, the Flock and Nest programs as well as the broader Aragon community. In the Strategy WG, items are discussed from an interdisciplinary perspective and should be assessed as part of the global Aragon landscape.

Examples of use-cases for the WG:

* Coordination on topics and projects involving two or more network entities or disciplines,
* Assessement of the current Network strategy,
* Discussions on Aragon Network Votes and Proposals,
* Addressing issues related to the governance of the Aragon Network and grant programs

**Calls** happen every two weeks on Fridays [here](https://meet.google.com/bye-ztbk-bfh?authuser=1) and are run according to an open agenda. They are not recorded at this time.

**Notes** taken during these calls can be found in the [Aragon Wiki](https://wiki.aragon.org/working-groups/meeting-notes/strategy-wg/Strategycall20190705/)

The **Strategy-WG [chat](https://aragon.chat/channel/wg-strategy)** is best used to advance discussions and update the group in between calls
