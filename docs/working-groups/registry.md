## Working Group Registry

### aragonSDK WG

We want to make the Aragon SDK a delightful developer experience. This is not necessarily limited to the CLI, but to all parts of the Aragon stack that target power users and developers, as opposed to users of the Aragon Client.

At the current time, however, our efforts are focused around the CLI to improve both developers' and power users' experiences.

**Offline discussions** occur in the [SDK Working Group channel](https://spectrum.chat/aragon/sdk-working-group).

**Stand ups** happen every Wednesday and Friday; please join the SDK-WG chat to introduce yourself if you would like to join.

Larger discussions related to the CLI and its direction will also be held in the [Aragon All Devs bi-weekly meetings](https://wiki.aragon.org/all_aragon_devs/overview/).
