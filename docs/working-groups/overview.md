# Aragon Working Groups

_Originally adapted from [this forum post](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragon-working-groups-applications-are-now-open/11290) by Louis Giraux._

Aragon Working Groups were first brought up by [John Light](https://forum.aragon.org/u/light) and detailed [here](https://forum.aragon.org/t/proposed-working-groups-for-the-aragon-network-dao/965?u=louisgrx).

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Officialize Aragon Working Groups as a collaboration tool in the Aragon community
2. Provide guidelines on how to officialize an Aragon Working Group

## Context

The Aragon Network DAO, encompassing the Aragon community, Nest, and Flock, has been expanding quickly. Specifically, the Flock program went from one to three teams in only six months and the number of active contributors to Aragon has been increasing. As a result, cooperation around different key matters has been emerging organically across teams, in chat rooms and on the Aragon forum. 

Working Groups are a way to formalize collaborative initiatives in order to make them accessible and visible to all, ultimately making it easier to collaborate across the ecosystem.

## Formalizing an Aragon Working Group

The formalization of Working Groups consists in making public their existence and bylaws.

A Working Group registry with key information on each Working Group is available here. The purpose of this registry is to legitimize a given Working Group and give it more visibility to all Aragon contributors.

### Definition of an Aragon Working group

Below are elements one may want to consider when creating an Aragon Working Group.

#### Foundations

* Purpose - What is the working group about?
* Membership - How to join?

#### Structure and operation suggestions

The following are suggestions for your Aragon Working Group structure:

* **Calls** - weekly or biweekly call with notes publicly published in the dedicated WG Wiki section
* **Facilitators** - Choose 2 facilitators who are rotating every week/ couple of weeks/meeting cycle. Facilitators are in charge of preparing the agenda for the call, asking people to take notes, and publishing the notes. They are also in charge of moderating the Working group chat.
* Decision making can be fluid, participatory, a do-ocracy like model
* Working groups can collaborate using focused discussion channels on Aragon Chat as well as a Github repository.
* Working groups can also adopt tags in the Aragon Forum to categorize threads around their specific projects.
* Working groups with multiple projects can have sub-groups with a subset of its members that are collaborating on more specific projects. These sub-groups can have their own processes for joining and participating, which should also be documented in the Working Group’s Aragon Wiki section.

#### Tooling suggestions

* **Aragon organization** - votes/surveys, membership, funds, project/bounties management.
* **Forum** - Formalized working groups can be attributed a sub-section on the Aragon forum to have threads related to work in WGs.
* **Chat channels** - WGs can have a dedicated chat room on the Aragon chat. If necessary it can be subdivided in teams.
* **GitHub repository** to organize work. We are also proposing to adopt [Taiga](https://taiga.io/) as a public task management tool for the Working Groups to coordinate and organize their work.

**Anyone can create and join a working group. If you want to officialize a Working Group, feel free to comment on this post or submit a PR to add it to the dedicated section of the Aragon Wiki. It will be reviewed and merged by the Aragon Association provided it addresses an unaddressed area and meets transparency standards.**
