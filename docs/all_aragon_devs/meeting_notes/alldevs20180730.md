## Notes

Actions Step: GRIFF: Reach out to Jordi, Barry, Adria for audit changes review.

Find a contingency for a second look at the contract audits (AragonOS)

Look at audit timeline for front end code (long term?)

- High level vs. react specifics?
  - Start looking into a high level audit around general assumptions
- Actions Step: GRIFF: Contact Adria for front end/contract review?

Aragon CLI:

- Bug: aragon run seems to serving old versions of an app sometimes, when used repeatedly (possibly due to arapp.json)
  - Aragon run completely ignores the arapp.json
  - Maybe aragon run doesn’t push some flags to its aragon publish task?
- Reduce build times / delays with developing using aragon run
  - Aragon run should use the http provider instead of ipfs to get hot reloading (this is already ready in the frontend) <- top priority
- Add option to avoid opening the browser on aragon run

Future of Aragon UI

- UI toolkit currently used to build aragon apps
  - Generalize it to a design system (so that anyone can use it, not just Aragon or blockchain apps)
  - What needs to be done to move in this direction?
    - Start building components specific to DApp needs (not just aragon apps)
    - Make sure that all standard UI toolkit components are provided
    - Support more than just the aragon colors
    - Rename it to be more generalized
      - Community vote to rename project
  - Potentially working with another team (Web3 UX) to build more components
    - They’re currently in the research phase for generic blockchain ui frameworks
  - Involve the DAC in building aragon-ui

Future of APM

- Built out of necessity: Aragon needed a package manager to provide a completely decentralized app
- Ability to “push” updates?
- Going forward will be working with a seperate team (Zeppelin) to potentially collaborate on a generalized version of APM while preserving the needs of Aragon
- Respect EthPM spec and try to move this standard forward
- Neutral branding
- See what potential use cases are for other projects and see how the tool can be adapted while preserving the needs of the Aragon ecosystem
- See what will be reused on the upgradability side of things; Zeppelin and Aragon have different approaches
- Sync up next core devs call

ETHBerlin

- CLI:
    - Documentation? ← highest leverage
        - CLI will have its own section in the documentation page
        - Derek and Arthur to set up call to go over documentation update
    - Mini hackathon in SF on Aug. 18 - 19 to test out documentation and CLI tooling
- Human resources:
    - Unclear at this time, due to uncertainty with hiring

Gitcoin

- Move over to Gitcoin from SOB
- Blocker for Giveth?: can’t directly use Gitcoin yet due to how transfering ETH to fund issues works right now (requires data)
- Maybe it’s only for creating a bounty?
- Will revisit

AragonOS storage

- Unstructured storage is a technique that zeppelin uses to abstract storage from contracts by ‘hiding’ the storage in the contract
- Allows new contracts to start at ‘slot 0’ storage
- Using unstructured storage would allow for new contract architectures in an easier way
- In order to implement this it would require a change in the way that storage is currently implemented in both AragonOS and aragon-apps
- When should this storage change be made? (ASAP, punt?)
    - Doing this later will make it impossible to migrate
    - Link to unstructured storage changes (see: [https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.zeppelinos.org/upgradeability-using-unstructured-storage/&sa=D&ust=1553113220560000&usg=AFQjCNGtmCUdjMSXTWnHSdQNz8oBDhvHOA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.zeppelinos.org/upgradeability-using-unstructured-storage/&sa=D&ust=1553113220560000&usg=AFQjCNGtmCUdjMSXTWnHSdQNz8oBDhvHOA))
- AragonOS versioning
- Move up to AragonOS 4.x.x
- Signal that there are breaking changes
