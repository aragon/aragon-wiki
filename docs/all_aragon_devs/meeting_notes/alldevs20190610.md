### Notes

#### Introductions
 - Javi, joined Autark, will be helping with front-end efforts 
 - Chad, joined Autark 2 weeks ago, will be helping with front-end and maybe some smart contracts stuff 
 - Xavier, joined Aragon Black last week, front-end development, will be focused on AragonPM front-end

### Updates

#### Aragon One

- Release of Aragon 0.7.3
    - Improvements for app caching, making second loads of apps instanteous
- Working on 0.7.4, looking to be released this week
    - Auto-complete for local identities in input fields
- Now focused on 0.8.0
- Facu focused on voting delegation ([apps#881](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/881))
- Had a mini-offsite on the Aragon Network, most relevant issue figured out

#### Autark
- Polish on the home app
    - Markdown and editor improvements
    - Dynamic home options and how to conect them with the smart contracts without modifying the kernel

- API changes on the forwarder, ready to review (link to PR)
    - Dynamic forwarders
 
- Team offsite:
    - First draft of next AGP, should be on forum soon
    - Security audit plan
    - TPS is being finalized for audits

#### Open Work Labs
- Integrate profiles as npm packages ([link to discussion PR](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/pull/810))
- Profiles:
    - Some [issues](https://github.com/AutarkLabs/aragon-profile/issues/1) with bundling IPFS, waiting for feedback before keep going forward

#### Aragon Mesh

- Include coveralls and been working on continious development
- New `dao act` command option that allow to send ETH with the Agent app
- Updating roadmap and make it accessible ([roadmap](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/blob/update-roadmap/docs-internal/Roadmap.md))
- Redeployed aragen snapshot fixing some issues, add survey app and survey-kit
- Deployed DAO aiming to test AGP-28 ([forum post](https://forum.aragon.org/t/test-organization-for-decentralizing-aragonpm-eth-agp-28/1029))
- Will be working on some CLI and APM issues
- Will release a new minor version

#### Aragon Black
- Contracts of Fundraising (Apiary) sent for audit
    - Quick internal review from A1

- Spend a lot of time trying to create a dao-kit 
    - Issue with docker deployment and being a monorepo
    - Will be avaible at the end of the week

- UI anuncements:
    - Support mobile
    - Design system will be avaible on the Fundraising app

- First discussions and definitions about the AragonPM front-end

#### Aragon Association

- Mostly working on previously existing projects for the next voting 
- Moving forward some security tasks
    - TPS audit

### Discussions 

#### Potential caching solutions (A1 / AB)
- Issue with caching
    - The first time is going to take a lot of time loading all previous events. This was a security decitions to not relay on other node.

- The next time you cache it will only cache the last information (30-60 seconds)
- Goal to make the first caching quick
    - How to share the reduce state between organizations
    - Use The Graph as solution

- Intro to The Graph:
    - Built a simple graph and simple index
    - It does mostly the same as the client does with events
    - It stores all in a database
    - It is still centralize on the The Graph server
        - How to decentrilize the structure
    - You need to give the address of the contract to listen the events. The issue is how to watch all the necesary infromation. This will be a problem cause it will make the information of all organization freely avaible.

- Consider as the main infrastructure of the state but it might add to much craft on the developer side.
    - May be useful for main Aragon apps

- Decentrilize caching server
    - Having a server database containg the reduce state. Need a verification to be confident about the reduce state we are getting from a databse.

- Other ideas:
    - Instead of linear proccess we could use parallel procceses to handle events
        - We can't jump ahead a lot of blocks and make other computation on the EVM
        - More dificult 
    - Trusting decentrilize server, optimistically trust an entity. A server can wrapp and entire state on a hash
        - Good use case, question on how can we make it possible

- Most application will keep the same model as right now (background worker that update the reduce state)

- Instead of using a server we could have permissions to get a hash state

#### IPFS follow-up

- Jonathan is working on a spec regarding IPFS cluster to work with smart-contracts based authentication

- Use case: Forwarders (voting app)

- Authenitcation layer:
    - List of authorized accounts
    - List of authorized CID

- We should reach out some people from the Ethereum community to see if there are other opinions/thoughts on the topic. We could share Jonathan's spec with them to have some feedback.

#### Accessing indexedDB through aragon apps

- No good solution yet. Focused on secure it more tightly as right now.

- No use case for an Aragon app, solution will be for other libraries.

- Revisit in the future, really big issue.
