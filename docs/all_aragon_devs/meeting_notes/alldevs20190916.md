### Discussions 

#### Opening up the aragon Github organization to community members (A1)
* Know who are developers of the Aragon organization
* Label users as Aragon dev community members
* Transition the GitHub orgs to a more open community of contribution
* Should start transitioning the Aragon org on Github to be more open and allow users to represent themselves as contributors to the Aragon github org
* Having a type of badge that show people contribution on diferent topics
* The biggest challenge is finding contributors outside github who have done valuable stuff in the forum and chat and elsewhere 


#### [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) / other hackathon participation (A1)
* Query to see if we are getting involve in this
* Wondering if we want to start showing up
* Casual hackathoon that university from Europe and USA organize
* Action item: define what we need from these hackathons and what are our goals do we want talent or testing? students attracted by 1: novelty and 2: opportunities (such as internship)
* Maybe we could link that to the 'Aragon Academy'
- Should we be doing more university outreach going forward? There aren't many left right now
- The season goes from the Fall to the early Spring
- [North America](https://mlh.io/seasons/na-2020/events)
- [Europe](https://mlh.io/seasons/eu-2020/events)

#### How should the GUI & CLI clients support apps without contracts (that may concern only the user, or may provide an UI alternative) ? (Mesh)
* Having the ability to use CLI extensions
* Have a way to install and uninstall them, how they comunicate with each other
* the pando app could extend th cli
- Might be good to build an extension pathway around building apps that don't need contracts
* An idea is to use a microkernel architecture and be closelly related with the UI
* How to deal with apps that don't have contracts?
    * Decouple this between diferent APM repos?
