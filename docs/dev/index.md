# Aragon Development Overview

The **[Developer Portal](https://hack.aragon.org)** provides all the info you need to get started creating Aragon apps.

The Aragon Association develops the [Aragon client](https://github.com/aragon/aragon) as a reference implementation for managing and navigating aragonOS-powered organizations, as well as a [set of Aragon apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps) which act as the initial functionality provided in all Aragon 0.6 organizations. Both are internally powered by a [JavaScript implementation of aragonAPI](https://github.com/aragon/aragon.js).

## Bug reports and feature requests

If you have encountered a bug with the Aragon client or would like to request additional features, please provide feedback by filing an issue in the [Aragon client repo](http://github.com/aragon/aragon) or sending us a message on our [#feedback channel](https://aragon.chat/channel/feedback).

## Security and smart contract bug reports

Bug bounties are available for security vulnerabilities affecting any smart contracts supporting the Aragon client. Please visit the [bug bounty page](./bug_bounty) for more information and how you can responsibly report issues to us.
