# Aragon client smart contracts bug bounty

A bug bounty for the smart contracts in the Aragon client is now live. We intend for hackers to look for smart contract vulnerabilities in our system that can lead to loss of funds or locked DAOs.

## Rewards

Vulnerability reports will be scored using the  [CVSS v3](https://www.first.org/cvss/) standard. The reward amounts for different types of vulnerabilities are:

!!! bug "**Critical** (CVSS 9.0 - 10.0)"
    $5,000 - $50,000

!!! danger "**Major** (CVSS 7.0 - 8.9)"
    $2,500 - $5,000

!!! fail "**Medium** (CVSS 4.0 - 6.0)"
    $1,000 - $2,500

!!! warning "**Low** (CVSS 1.0 - 3.9)"
    $500-$1,000

Rewards will be awarded at the sole discretion of the Aragon Association. Quality of the report and reproduction instructions can impact the reward. Rewards will be paid out in ETH.

For this initial bug bounty program, there is a **maximum bounty pool of $250,000**.

The bug bounty program will run for a minimum of three months, starting October 17th, 2018.

## Reporting

!!! note "Reporting a found vulnerability"
    - In order to report a vulnerability, please write an email to security@aragon.org with [BUG BOUNTY] in the subject of the email.
    - For sensitive vulnerabilities, please the encrypt the email using this [PGP key](rsc/security.asc) (Fingerprint: `B6D5 1396 4B9C 62B7`)
    - We will make our best effort to reply in a timely manner and provide a timeline for resolution.
    - Please include a detailed report on the vulnerability with clear reproduction steps. The quality of the report can impact the reward amount.

## Scope

In scope for the bug bounty are all the smart contract components of the Aragon client. They can be found on three main repositories:

!!! abstract "**aragonOS 4** ([https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS@4.0.0](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v4.0.0) and [future patch versions](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/releases))"
    Smart contract framework and the core of the system.

    - Solidity code under the `contracts` directory:
        - Excluding `contracts/lib/ens` contracts
        - Excluding `contracts/test/`

!!! abstract "**aragon-apps** ([https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master) on the [master branch](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master))"
    Contracts for Aragon apps developed by the Aragon Association and are used by default in most Aragon 0.6 organizations.

    - Solidity code under `apps/**/contracts` (`voting`, `vault`, `finance`, `token-manager`, `survey`)
        - Excluding `contracts/test`
    - Solidity code under `shared/minime/contracts`

!!! abstract "**dao-templates** ([https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits/tree/master) on the [master branch](https://github.com/aragon/dao-kits/tree/master))"
    On-chain deployment templates for Aragon DAOs.

    - Solidity code for the following templates: `bare`, `beta-base`, `democracy`, `multisig`, `survey`
        - Excluding `contracts/test`

You can find their deployed addresses on live networks in our [deployment documentation](https://github.com/aragon/deployments).

## Areas of interest

!!! tip "These are some examples of vulnerabilities that would be interesting"
    - Bypassing ACL rules to get unauthorized access to an app.
    - A user of an app performing an action that could freeze or lock the contract.
    - Being able to escalate permissions using the Voting app or Token Manager without a proper vote being successful.

## Out of scope

!!! question "What we consider out of scope for this bug bounty"
    - Side-effects of properly authenticated smart contract upgrades or contract upgrades that change the storage layout of a contract.
    - Revocation of permissions or completely changing how a DAO operates due to important permission being granted through the proper processes.
    - Any frontend applications or client-side code interacting with the contracts, as well as testing code.
    - Mismatch of the functionality of the contracts and outdated spec documents.

## Resources

!!! snippet "Documentation and resources for hackers"
    - [Reference and documentation for aragonOS 4](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-ref.html) as well as a [list of the changes that have been made for aragonOS 4 from aragonOS 3](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/wiki/aragonOS-4:-Updates-to-aragonOS-and-aragon-apps).
    - [Documentation on how aragonOS apps should be developed](https://hack.aragon.org/docs/aragonos-building.html).
    - [Documentation for our smart contract deployments to live networks](https://github.com/aragon/deployments).


## Eligibility

!!! success "Terms for eligible bounties"
    - Only unknown vulnerabilities will be awarded a bounty; in case of duplicate reports, the first report will be awarded the bounty.
    - Public disclosure of the vulnerability, before explicit consent from Aragon to do so, will make the vulnerability ineligible for a bounty.
    - Attempting to exploit the vulnerability in a public Ethereum network will also make it ineligible for a bounty.
