# [Aragon Apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps)

Aragon maintains a set of default apps that can be used to run basic organizations. These apps serve as an example of how [AragonOS](../AragonOS.md) compatible apps are built.

At the moment, there are six apps as part of the [**aragon-apps** repository](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps):

- [Voting](voting.md)
- [Token Manager](token-manager.md)
- [Group](group.md)
- [Fundraising](fundraising.md)
- [Vault](vault.md)
- [Finance](finance.md)
