    AraCon – The first Aragon Conference - will take place in Berlin, Germany on January 29th-30th 2019.

    The conference will bring together people who embody and wish to shape the Aragon community. Those who are building and supporting the pseudonymous, secure, trustless future — the decentralized web. Decentralized governance and DAOs are at the heart of the new Web 3.0. They are key components in moving towards a more fair and open world for everyone.
