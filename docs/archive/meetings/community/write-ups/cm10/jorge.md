## Aragon Community Meeting 10 Write-Up for March 2018

### Jorge â€“ Tech lead

#### Finally launched Aragon v0.5! ðŸš€ðŸ¦…

- Release notes: [https://github.com/aragon/aragon/releases/tag/0.5.0](https://github.com/aragon/aragon/releases/tag/0.5.0)

- So proud the work the entire team has done to get us here ðŸ’ž

- Launch was flawless from the communications and community side and technically
no big issues have been raised. So congrats everyone on an amazingly uneventful
launch!

#### Helped onboard [Chris Remus](https://blog.aragon.one/team-interviews-chris-aragons-product-manager-c243c716213), Aragon's product manager

- Chris joined us in Madrid the first week of March, for a productive week of
organizing the product pipeline and assess our current processes.

- Chris already helped a lot coordinating and organizing the last mile of the v0.5 launch,
and he will be the owner of the next development cycles.

#### Tech

- [New Vault](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/129) with support for
arbitrary token standards was developed and integrated as part of the release.
With this new Vault, Aragon organizations are able to own ERC777 and ERC721 NFTs
in an easy way.

- We deployed the first instance of [apm-serve](https://github.com/aragon/apm-serve)
a bridge to APM in the web2 at [aragonpm.com](http://aragon.aragonpm.com)

- Worked on the server infrastructure to support Aragon v0.5. Even though it is
fully decentralized and trustless thanks to IPFS and the APM, having some support
nodes is helpful. Anyway all state is computed trustlessly on every client, no
node-mongo stack. We have also hired a devops to help us take our server infrastructure
to the next level.

- Jordi Baylina and the team at [DappNode](https://twitter.com/DAppNODE) [deployed
the first Aragon Package Manager](https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/974203914659729408)
Registry in the Ethereum mainnet, making it the first mainnet live Aragon DAO.

#### Standards
