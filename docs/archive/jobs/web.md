# Web Developer opening at Aragon One

Aragon is an open source, decentralized project [fighting for the freedom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqjIWmiAidw) to organize. We believe that decentralized organizations can solve the world's worst problems.

We're looking for a Web Developer to work with us creating and maintaining stunning websites and landing pages for all of Aragon. Our Web Developer must not only be a frontend expert but also care about detail and have a taste for good design. Our ideal candidate is not only a respected engineer but also a decentralization advocate.

- Work with our Design Lead to transform ideas and designs into modern, clean, and readable code.
- Collaborate with the product team and the communication team to define how to properly communicate what we do by building great web experiences.

### Requirements

- Expert understanding of: Modern JavaScript (ES6+), CSS, React and resource optimization.
- Proven ability to ship quality, well-crafted websites within tight deadlines.
- Being passionate about open source and decentralization.
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for time self-management. We work focus-driven, not hours-driven.

### Good to have

- Previous experience working remotely.
- Very good written communication skills.
- Attention to UX/UI design.
