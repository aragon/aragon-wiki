## Notes on discussions

### KPIs

Organization related KPIs. 
- Activity is one KPI, txn volume of all apps in the org
    - This tells us about the traction of Aragon
- Total AUM
- Amount of ANT held 
    - Orgs are stakeholders of the community
    - If you buy ANT to try to game the app mining, you pay for it

- It is important to be able to communicate that in a clear and succint way is going to be important to play the game.

- AUM vs. Activity volume. What is their respective impact on ANT price?
    - You need activity volume to generate fees with services such as Aragon Chain. Assets under management is an indirect KPI to the trust people have in the platform.

- A growth KPI could be taken into account somewhere. To incentivize getting more organizations to participate.

- Activity cannot be tracked as a per app basis. Some apps will have by default high volumes, some less. Its the organization score that matters and is split among all apps.

- Blockstack app mining is very heavily distributed towards top 5 apps 77% of all rewards. 
    - This is something we may want to rethink. Maybe based on app scores rather than exponential distribution. In that case application score itself is a percentage of the whole reward pool.

There is a Futarchy experiment going on right now using ANT price. Maybe we could try to use it with some of the KPIs above.

### Strategy report 

on hold

### Budget

- Luke feels budget is positive as people start to pay attention to it.
- Joe thinks that we miss the department allocation of the budget.
- Burrrata thinks incentives are weird in the current AGP-103. We need more simple and easy to understand budget.
- Yalda thinks we need more time to come up with a good budget proposal. 
- Luis echoes Yalda thoughts on the fact that we need more time.
- Aaron thinks we need different categories of spending for the budget.
- Louis thinks its important to create collaboration spaces.
