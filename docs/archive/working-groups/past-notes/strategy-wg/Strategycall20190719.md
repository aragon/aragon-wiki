# Strategy call #2 Notes and action steps

##### Next call will happen on the 2nd of August

Below is a summary of the discussions that happened during the last Flock Strategy Call.

### Objectives
We have mostly a consensus over high level objectives for the coming months.

#### Highlights
- onboarding users (mostly projects)
- finding specific use cases to deploy
- use that feedback to work on the product

####  Action steps for next call
- **Teams prepare to share their preferred approaches to fulfill these objectives in the quarter** (templates, onboarding, comms...)

### Target Market
During the discussion on Objectives, a second question naturally emerged: what is the target market/users? Should they be the same for all teams or different for each team?

#### Highlights
- It is important that teams share and understand each other's ideas on target markets
- Target projects rather than consumers
- Monitor trends in cyrpto and try to answer them
- Not clear yet what the pros and cons are in the two following settings:
    - Flock teams each target different users/markets
    - Flock teams focus on a single market

####  Action steps for next call
- **Teams prepare to share on their preferred target market**
- Determine if all Flock teams should pursue the same strategy or not

#### Development work
We've been discussing how to organize development work among Flock teams.

#### Highlights
- Repo ownership can be useful to work more efficiently among Flock teams: knowing who to ping, more flexibility to review code and merge, accountability, decentralization
- A design and feasibility phase to discuss code before implementation is a good practice. Coordination can be done through WGs

####  Action steps for next call
- Think about who should own what repo
- WGs to be deployed
