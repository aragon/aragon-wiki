# Strategy WG call #7 - notes

## Topics

### Working Groups
- working groups have not ended up being what we'd really like to have
- we dont have the root incentives to make WGs useful, the way teams collaborate should push for this and it is not the case
- One way to make them more useful could be to have working group calls around specific topics on a ad-hoc bais, rather than a general call on a recurring basis
- We should prepare more specific topics in working groups and have the right persons in the discussion
- use Kialo to have debates async and enhance debates and have more informed debates in working groups. Create a Kialo on a specific topic. For example roadmaps and initiatives.

### Forum discussions
- Lots has been said on the forum, looking forward to finishing discussions
- It is kind of an organizational cycle that comes to an end
- The budget AGP could be interesting to implement a natural unbundling of Flock team proposals
- Flock teams could submit initiatives that get evaluated and modified on a rolling basis
- This could help teams work together and coordinate more often, and make everything more flexible
