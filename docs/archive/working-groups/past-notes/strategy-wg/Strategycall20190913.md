# Strategy WG call #6 - notes



**Topics**

## kleros forum thread

- Have someone write an article about the thread and fund this through CFDAO
- Interesting ways to collaborate can be Nest or bonding curve alignement for the 2 projects

## What scope of organizational activities do we want to focus on/specialize in with the Aragon product?
- Work on governance capabilities
- Credao is going to be an interesting experiment
- People don't know how to configure their organization. Need to create a design lab with good ux to create templates easily
- Adding apps should be like web 2, you choose all the options and then get it deployed
- Segmentation into apps can be a problem if you don't have a global interface. apps for backend and then different interfaces that you choose from. This implies less flexibility
- With resources running low and no real traction from users, how do we chose what to specialize in?
- We need to build this backend without bottlenecks for developer to work so easily. Then evangelize it
- Help people who are capable to work with our tools walk the last mile, we need an oboarding team to create usages
- Without the subsequent apps, governance as a value proposition is less powerful as you don't have the tools to enforce decisions with the same security/transparency principles
- Make templates WITH interfaces for different use cases, have a team continuously do that and focus on generating templates
- Maybe we can stop giving lump sums away for funding teams and find other ways to do it

## Aragon Academy
- Aragon Black is going to take apprentices to onboard people
- Deliver classes on the Aragon Infrastructure, film and publish on Youtube
- Create an ambassador program for Aragon
- Third program in the network besides Flock and Nest that would train community members to participate in the community or evangelize Aragon in their own network and benefit from it
- Weekly workshop in Berlin giving Aragon Courses. DAO Incubator could be a platform to do that
