# Strategy call #3, notes and Action Steps


* What are Flock team’s preferred target market?
* What are Flock team’s preferred strategies to reach these target markets?
* Splitting stack ownership among Flock teams
* Launch strategy for fundraising
* Review the first iteration of the Flock objectives process [AA]

## Action items:

- Fundraising: start audits of onboarding contract
- To reduce duplicated efforts, perhaps have a shared CRM tool between flock teams? Find an open source CRM tool? Coordinate on rocket chat
- Develop shared resources to share between teams, e.g. list of demo organizations
- Aragon Black to coordinate with Autark on introducing the Projects app to teams being onboarded to Fundraising
- Fundraising Gantt chart: set up a shared version, where we can all access it and get a broader view. Research a common project management tool?
- Nice to have: a dedicated person/team that can take documents/templates developed for internal sharing and partner onboarding and translate them for mass consumption with nice graphic design etc.  Examples: court readme, permisisons diagram, dao/apps that can be explained to the public
    
## Notes

### What are Flock team’s preferred target market?

AB:

- Be selective, find projects that can independently execute and have strategic synergies with the Aragon ecosystem (e.g. by creating generic templates)
    - Mechanism designers
    - Activist / sustainability bias
    - Finding organizations that may need more than just simple pieces, e.g. complex value flows for researchers
- Fundraising: great tool to reach new (underfunded) teams in the crypto space
- Verticals of projects targeted: target c-org type of projects where revenues can feed back into the curve. Have 5 star projects that can showcase interest in curves and form basis for good and diverse example uses cases for replication.
- Onboarding:
    - Well-defined process for applications
    - Focus on mechanism design
    - Hold "hacking sessions" on their designs, defining scope of what can be implemented
    - Goal of creating digestable templates for other DAOs to be inspired from, create workshops and publications around these

A1:

- Less-formal onboarding process; mostly outbound and adhoc inbound requests based on connections
- Implementation Proposal Document: help guide the onboarder and onboarding team to define their organization
- For A1 quality is the focus over quantity. Onboarding projects and educate them on the whole Aragon ecosystem and permissions system
- Aiming for 5, or 10 or 20 high quality use cases

Luke:

- User value: transparency is very important (e.g. non-profit, charity, etc.)
    - Improves organization if their financial and operations management are done in the open
- Gap: current UI is made for day-to-day internal organization operations, but some use cases may want a more streamlined process for one-off proposals by external contributors (e.g. asking for membership)

Autark:

- To decide if focus should be on crypto projects first
- Would like to focus on global challenges, social sustainability projects
- Find organic DAO use cases; simple mission, self-organizing, self-sustaining


## How Flock teams work together going to market: Gateway strategy

- Gateway approach to acquiring users, come for the money and stay for the apps, come for project management stay for modularity...

## Launch strategy for fundraising

- What is comms strategy, what is the angle, do we make that a big deal or is it a soft launch?...
- Worth it to delay the mainnet launch for a fully audited version of the onboarding contract (needs to be done ASAP)
- First deploy on rinkeby around Aug. 15, do some teasers
- Talk about it during Blockchain Week in Berlin and have it released on mainnet in September
- Maintaining hype through curve analysis of the fundraising orgs, fuel next batch of orgs to be onboarded
- Need Olivier's and Brett's thoughts on when we could spread the launch a bit more. At the beginning onboard projects and get experience from these first onboardings.
