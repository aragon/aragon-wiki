# Aragon Multisig structure

!!! quote ""
    Having a good multisig structure is important for security, ANT holders trust and ensuring the project can and will do everything as planned.

    The Aragon Network Token sale featured two multisigs:

    !!! abstract ""
        - The Aragon Association Multisig
            - [**Read more**](association.md).

    !!! info ""
        - The Community Multisig.
            - [**Read more**](community.md).

    Both use Gnosis Multisig at commit [25fba5](https://github.com/ConsenSys/gnosis-contracts/blob/25fba563d95bbc8361c7de75801c38ce368cab85/contracts/solidity/Wallets/MultiSigWallet.sol) which was independently audited. Aragon multisigs were compiled using Solidity v0.4.8 with optimization disabled.
