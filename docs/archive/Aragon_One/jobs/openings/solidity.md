# Senior Solidity/EVM/Ethereum opening at Aragon One

We are looking for an Ethereum expert to work with us on [Aragon](https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS) and the upcoming [Aragon Network](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/raw/master/Aragon%20Whitepaper.pdf).

### Requirements

- **Expert understanding** of Ethereum and the inner workings of the EVM.
- Provable ability to ship **high quality, well crafted code** running on Ethereum.
- Strong **unit testing** culture.
- Being passionate about **decentralization** (having some concerns is totally fine, we all do).
- Being an autonomous individual with a proactive attitude and a love for **time self-management** (We are focus-driven work, not hours-driven).

### Good to have

- Interest and knowledge in **cryptoeconomics**.
- Experience contributing or managing **open source projects**.
- Very good **written communication** skills.

### Extra

- We will **reward referrals** for successful hires up to **10% of the first yearly salary**. This would be done with a vesting type smart contract that would be voided in case the hire leaves the organization.

### How to apply

Write the contract component of a new Aragon App that either improves upon one of our current [apps](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps) or is an entirely new use case that you think will wow us. The final contract should be deployable to the EVM (ignoring gas costs) and published to GitHub (public or private). Send us the link to the repo plus any information you consider important to *hiring@aragon.one*, with the subject `Solidity opening application`.
