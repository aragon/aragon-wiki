## June

### [**Aragon Frontend Walkthrough**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-frontend-walkthrough/)
**Earlier I was asked to present the frontend architecture that powers and runs the Aragon client. This post shares and describes what that entails**

> This past February, ßingen (an Aragon colleague) and I attended the Ethereum Dev Barcelona meetup. After the presentations, we had the opportunity to meet with the other attendees and share our ideas. As part of the conversation, we were introduced to Jose Luis Muñoz and found out he is the director for the Master's degree in blockchain technologies at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. We shared with him some of our day-to-day activities, and he thought it would be fun for us to showcase Aragon by proposing a lecture & workshop about it for their students. We were excited. What a thrilling opportunity!

### [**Proposal Agreements and the Aragon Court**](https://blog.aragon.one/proposal-agreements-and-the-aragon-court/)
**This post discusses how an organization will be able to create a Proposal Agreement, common use cases these agreements enable, and dependencies on the court**

> As a set of smart contracts deployed to a blockchain, Aragon organizations are able to operate securely, transparently, and reliably. They can define permissions, manage funds, and require stakeholders to vote on actions. An organization can even perform arbitrary transactions and be used as a collectively-managed, permissioned Web3 wallet.

### [**Aragon One mid-2019 roadmap update**](https://blog.aragon.one/mid-2019-roadmap-update/)
**Aragon One has already completed 30% of its roadmap for 2019**

> In January 2019, ANT holders welcomed Aragon One as a Flock team. They approved our roadmap for 2019, which was recently updated. I'll provide a brief status update, and also provide a breakdown initiative by initiative.

### [**Aragon Network Vote #2 Review**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-vote-2-review/)
**On April 27, 2019 Aragon Network Vote #2 (ANV-2) concluded.**

> This post is going to review what different commentators and stakeholders have said about the vote, and also share some of my own thoughts about what we can learn from the process, the results, and how to continue improving Aragon’s governance processes going forward.

### [**Team Interviews: Adri, Brand Designer at Aragon One**](https://blog.aragon.one/team-interviews-adri-brand-lead-at-aragon-one/)
**A film-maker, a world-class designer, the one responsible for the Aragon logo and branding.**

### [**Futarchy Courts**](https://blog.aragon.one/futarchy-courts/)
**Well constructed futarchy decision markets can be highly collusion resistant. This post goes into detail about what they are exactly and of their importance**

> There are now over 500 Aragon organizations on mainnet and over 500 thousand dollars in ETH, ANT, DAI, and other assets held within organization vaults. The number of weekly active organizations has been increasing, going from 18 in January, to 45 in the last week in April. These numbers may seem modest, but it’s important to remember how early we still are. The realization of an economy dominated by blockchain-native organizations will take time. There will need to be experimentation and iteration along the way. Not to mention improvements to user experience and scalability of blockchain infrastructure.

### [**Aragon Network and Token Primer**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-and-token-primer/)
**The expectation is that as the Aragon Network DAO proves successful, more authority will be transferred away from the Aragon Association and into the hands of the Aragon Network. With this, ANT holders will gain more direct control of the Aragon project**

> Governance, whether of a company, state, or blockchain, fundamentally boils down to who is a stakeholder and the rights to which those stakeholders are entitled. If you fail to clearly define stakeholders, or fail to establish and enforce their rights, governance has likely already failed. Establishing stakeholders and their rights is not sufficient to have effective governance, but it is a necessary prerequisite.

### [**Data-informed, vision-driven, user-obsessed**](https://blog.aragon.one/data-informed-vision-driven-user-obsessed/)
**Making the most of idealism, data, and user feedback**

> Aragon has always been a very idealist project. It's not an IoT juicer or an app to send Yo to your bros. It's a vision of how the world should be, it's a fight for freedom.

## April

### [**Activism on Aragon**](https://blog.aragon.one/activism-on-aragon/)
**Aragon has the potential to unleash a new wave of activism.**

> Thanks to Aragon, an activist group could raise funds from anyone in the world. Donors could remain totally anonymous to avoid oppression.

## March

### [**Designing the Developer Experience for Decentralized Platforms**](https://blog.aragon.one/designing-the-developer-experience-for-decentralized-platforms/)
**Without developers, it is impossible to reach users.**

> Let's explore what it takes for a decentralized project to bootstrap a developer ecosystem with some examples of what's effective and ineffective in developer relations.

## February

### [**Aragon Network Vote #1 Review**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-network-vote-1-review/)
**This post will review what went well and what could be improved in Aragon Network Vote #1 (ANV-01).**

> While we aren’t going to be able to build the perfect governance system, toolchain, and communications plan overnight, we can use this feedback to inform a plan that improves on all these areas incrementally over time.

### [**Releasing Aragon Agent beta**](https://blog.aragon.one/aragon-agent-beta-release/)
**Aragon Agent is a fully-fledged Ethereum account owned by an Aragon organization.**

> Agent also allows organizations to interact with other organizations, opening up an incredible amount of experimentation with inter-organization interactions.

### [**Running Aragon One as a remote team**](https://blog.aragon.one/running-aragon-one-as-a-remote-team/)
**Aragon One has been a remote team since day one.**

> Something interesting about remote teams is that they are very recent. There isn't much prior knowledge on how to run them.

### [**Optimist off-chain data availability**](http://blog.aragon.one/optimistic-meets-off-chain-data-availability/)
**The optimist pattern allows for offloading heavy computation from the EVM**

>  However, in order to assume the result is legit, the input data to the function (and not just its hash) must be made publicly available so that any watcher can challenge the result on-chain in a non-interactive way.
