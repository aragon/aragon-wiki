#### Introductory note
This guide can be used by Flock program applicants in order to draft their ideal **Flock Tragck AGP**. The structure and content of the proposal can be adapted as much as necessary by the applicant team. Above all, applications should be **clear and concise**.

Don't forget to share the proposal as early as possible with the [community](https://forum.aragon.org/).

# Aragon Flock proposal: Team name

## 1. Summary

### Strategy
*This section should detail the high level strategy and rational behind the proposal in simple terms. It can be accompanied by a few short references to past team achievements.*

*In case the applicant team is an ongoing Flock team it can add the previously achieved roadmap and its most recent community reports.*

### Why us?
*In this part the applicant team should qualitatively explain why it is qualified to deliver the strategy outlined in the previous section.*

### Working in the Aragon Community

*In this section, teams should succintly explain why their time is better spent contributing to Aragon.*

*Members of the Aragon community are united around the [Aragon Manifesto](https://blog.aragon.org/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03/) and values of openness, freedom and goodwill.  While there are no requirements to refer to the above explicitly, teams are encouraged to speak from their heart. Technicals are not the only thing!*

## 2. Deliverables

### Projected capacity table
*This table aims at giving a visual summary of the applicant team's effort allocation over the different categories of deliverables.*

#### Example 1
> | Category               | Dev tools | Aragon apps | User experience  | XYZ |
> |------------------------|-----------|-------------|------------------|-----|
> | Nb of  deliverables    | 2         | 1           | 3                | 1   |
> | Team effort  allocated | 30%       | 20%         | 40%              | 10% |

#### Example 2
|  Initiative            |  Projected Capacity (%)  |
| ---------------------------- | ----: |
|  01 - Working on initiative 01      |      34  |
|  02 - Working on initiative 02             | 28     |
|  03 - Working on initiative 03 | 16 |
| 04 - Working on initiative 04 | 14 |
| 05 - Working on initiative 05  | 8 |


Note: there is no strict format required for the table.

### Initiatives

*In this section, the applicant team should detail in concrete terms the different initiatives it is planning to work on. They should be listed by order of priority.*

For each initiative, the applicant team should cover the following items:
- **Value proposition** - *How it will provide value to the end user (i.e. developer or Aragon DAO user)*
- **Deliverables** - *What precisely will be implemented in to fulfill this initiative*
- **Background** - *A link to a Github issue, Flock roadmap item, Nest proposal, user feedback, or any other material backing the initiative's relevancy*
- **Long-term vision for initiative** - *This last item is optional and can provide more insights on future developments built on top of the initiative*

#### Example

*Here is an example of initiative inspired from a past Flock application.*

> ### I01 - Fundraising
> #### Value proposition
> The goal of this topic is to provide a library and a standalone dApp any Aragon DAO can use to raise funds through a Continuous Funding scheme.
>
> #### Deliverables
>
> **Fundraising library:** Develop a modular fundraising library providing low-level building-blocks: curves, taxation mechanisms, withdrawal mechanisms, etc.
>
> **Fundraising app:** Develop an opinionated but ready-to-use fundraising app - based on the previous library - implementing the [Apiary][link] scheme designed by [@lkngtn][link].
>
> #### Background
>
> A PoC of such a fundraising app is already available [here][link] and demoed [here][link].
