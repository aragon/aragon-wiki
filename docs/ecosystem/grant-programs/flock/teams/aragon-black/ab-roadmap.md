# Aragon Flock proposal: Aragon Black <img align="right" src=".github/images/logo.png" height="80px" />

## Summary

**Aragon Black** is a team whose core members come majoritarily from the **Pando Network** team [mostly known in the ecosystem for the development of the pando protocol]. The Pando Network team has been working closely with the Aragon ecosystem for almost a year now and has been the recipient of two Aragon Nest grants: [[1][28] & [2][29]].

To strengthen its commitment to the Aragon movement, the Pando Network team has decided to **apply to the Flock program as Aragon Black**. This first Flock proposal covers six months of work. However, if the Aragon community lends us its trust, we intend to re-apply to this program on the long run.

Our long term vision is to **turn Aragon into the go-to choice to decentralize the governance of open-source projects and common goods**. Thus, our work will focus on a. providing the tools to experiment with new economic dynamics [[I01]](#i01---fundraising) ; b. providing the tools to maintain open-source projects over Aragon [[I02]](#i02---aragonpm) [[I03]](#i03---aragon-development-infrastructure) ; c. improve some core components of the Aragon stack [[I04]](#i04---generics--aragon-stack) and ; d. on-board non-tech-savvy people and real common-driven projects into the Aragon Ecosystem [[I05]](#i05---generics--aragon-community--ecosystem).

To cover its operating costs for six months [Q3 & Q4 2019] and contribute creating a thriving Aragon ecosystem, Aragon Black requests:

- \$450k paid in DAI [or any other stable assets].
- 125k ANT for incentivization purposes.

**Note.** AGP quarterly votes happen at the end of each quarter. Thus, even if this Flock proposal intends to be submitted to the Q2 2019 AGP vote, its funds would [hopefully] cover our operating costs for Q3 & Q4 2019. If this proposal makes it through the ballot, we intend to re-submit a longer proposal at the Q4 2019 AGP vote.

**Note.** This proposal introduces the short-term outputs we intend to deliver by the end of 2019. Besides these immediates deliverables, we are also working on providing long-term sustainability to the Aragon ecosystem. As the leads to achieve this sustainability are still under heavy discussion within the community, we won't discuss their details in this proposal. For a deeper view, these leads are synthesized in a forum post [here](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragon-flock-proposal-aragon-black/646/19).

## Deliverables

We are splitting deliverables across the following initiatives:

### I01 - Fundraising

The goal of this topic is to provide a library and a standalone dApp any Aragon DAO can use to raise funds through a Continuous Funding scheme.

#### 2019 deliverables

**Fundraising library.** Develop a modular fundraising library providing low-level building-blocks: curves, taxation mechanisms, withdrawal mechanisms, etc.

**Fundraising app.** Develop an opinionated but ready-to-use fundraising app - based on the previous library - implementing the [Apiary][4] scheme designed by [@lkngtn][5].

#### Longer-term deliverables

**Fee and signaling.** Design and discuss a token economics model for Apiary, relying on buy / sell orders fee and an ANT-based staking mechanism for DAO signaling.

**Discovery platform.** Develop an Aragon Network wide fundraising platform allowing Aragon users to discover and join new DAOs.

#### Resources

A PoC of such a fundraising app is already available [here][6] and demoed [here][7].

### I02 - aragonPM

The goal of this initiative is to enhance aragonPM to the point where it become a serious - and backward compatible - alternative to NPM.

#### 2019 deliverables

**Frontend.** Develop a dApp allowing to easily search and browse through aragonPM registries and repos [an aragonPM equivalent to [npmjs.com][3]].

**NPM compatibility.** Develop an enhanced version of aragonPM-serve complying with the NPM Registry API to enforce aragonPM - NPM compatibility.

#### Longer-term deliverables

**Linking fee and insurance**. Design and discuss an ANT-based token economics model for aragonPM registries, relying on linking fees and an insurance system.

**pando | aragonPM.** Develop a common contribution and dependency tracking system shared by aragonPM and pando to serve as the foundation of a possible token-economic model for aragonPM repos.

### I03 - Aragon Development Infrastructure

The goal of this initiative is to drive Aragon's development to a higher degree of decentralization thanks to pando [a decentralized VCS our team as been working on for the last past year thanks to the Nest program].

#### 2019 deliverables

**Pando.** Keep on developing and enhancing the pando protocol and all related DAO templates for mainnet launch.

**Experimentation.** Experiment using pando to host non-sensitive Aragon repositories: documentation, Aragon Monthly, etc.

#### Longer-term deliverables

**Contribution economics.** Work closely with all the other Aragon teams to design [and experiment with] possible reward systems for Aragon contributors.

**GitHub drop-out.** Support Aragon teams in experimenting with pando to gradually migrate Aragon codebase to a fully decentralized infrastructure.

**PandoHub / AragonHub.** Ship everything we have learned in this initiative into a ready-to-use decentralized alternative to GitHub.

**Custom Open Source licence.** Deliver of a fork of the [Contributive Commons Licence][1] in order to implement an isomorphism between DAOs governance rules - as defined through blockchain-based smart contracts - and nation-states juridical frameworks.

#### Resources

You can have a quick overview of Pando by watching the talk we gave at [AraCon][2] and try our Rinkeby app by reading our [announcement](https://forum.aragon.org/t/pando-live-on-rinkeby/712) and watching our [demo/tutorial](https://vimeo.com/328713388).

### I04 - Generics | Aragon Stack

The Aragon Black team is committed to help improving the existing Aragon stack in every aspect it entails with a particular focus on the following topics.

**Monolithic app.** Work closely with all the other Aragon team to allow Aragon apps to handle multiple contracts.

**CLI apps.** Enhance the aragonCLI to potentially serve as a foundational layer for aragon-related node / CLI apps.

#### Resources

Work as already been undertaken in collaboration with the Aragon Mesh team regarding the extensibility of the aragon CLI. More informations are available in this forum [post](https://forum.aragon.org/t/aragoncli-extensibility/680).

### I05 - Generics | Aragon Community / Ecosystem

The Aragon Black team is committed to help extend the existing Aragon community / ecosystem and spread the philosophy of Aragon's [manifesto][8] in every aspect it entails with a particular focus on the following topics.

#### 2019 deliverables

**On-boarding.** Help on-board common-driven organizations [political organizations, artistic organizations, cooperatives, etc.] into the Aragon ecosystem to develop real-world use cases.

**Interviews / theorization.** Manage interviews with and publications from « outsiders » of our crypto-ecosystem: political activists, philosophers, etc. Aragon Black has a long experience in the publishing / journalism field. We thus intend to launch a dedicated blog to drive dialogues and theorization experimentations around the DAO / crypto landscape.

**Book.** Publish, at the end of this year, a book compiling these articles [under a CC licence] to offer the Aragon ecosystem more visibility outside of the crypto-space.

#### Longer-term deliverables

**Aragon / pando based publishing platform.** Develop a Medium-like dApp based on Aragon / pando allowing to « thank » and reward authors, proofreaders, etc. through an Aragon DAO linked token.

## Grant size

We would like to request **\$450k** paid in DAI to cover the operating costs of Q3 & Q4 2019. These funds would be used as follow.

### Estimated operating costs for Q2 and Q3 2019

### ANT package

We would like to request **25k ANT per team member per year** for incentivization purpose, i.e. **125k ANT** for this six months long proposal. We are committed to the Aragon Network in the long-term and therefore accept a 4-years vesting schedule.
