!!! failure "Unacceptable behaviors"

We have a list of unacceptable behaviors. Please familiarize yourself with them before joining the project so you can help us support a healthy community. This is not a complete list, and our moderators have discretion over which comments they moderate. If you try to be the best person you can be when you are in our community spaces, you will probably be okay.

Details about how to reach out to moderators with reports or questions can be found below.

- Ad hominem and other name-calling
- Stalking or harassment (repeated unwanted contact, including sexual advances)
- Any sexually or violently explicit content (NSFW)
- Hate towards people due to their race, gender, sexual preferences, or any other reason
- Flame wars
- Sharing or requesting NCC and/or PII (e.g. doxxing)
- False accusations or accusations without evidence
- Spam (unsolicited off-topic messages, especially commercial in nature)
- Inciting or threatening violence, including encouraging others to hurt themselves
- Repeatedly yelling (i.e. ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation points!!!)
- Coordinating “pumps” or “dumps” of financial assets or other market manipulation, including excessive shilling

## Our Responsibilities
The Aragon team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The Aragon team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting
If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact moderators through the following channels: 

Direct message chat moderator @light on [Aragon Chat](https://aragon.chat/)
Flag any post and/or send a direct message to “moderators” in the [Aragon Forum](https://forum.aragon.org/)
Report any post and/or send a direct message to the [/r/AragonProject subreddit](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/aragonproject) moderators

If the person who is harassing you is one of the moderators, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident and triage to another moderator. We will respond as promptly as possible.

In order to protect the Aragon team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all of Aragon project's spaces, including the Aragon client, Aragon Forum, Aragon Chat, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and all other spaces associated with the Aragon project, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Aragon team. Some of the Aragon project's spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community.

## Enforcement
Moderators will generally follow this standard response protocol for infringements of this Code of Conduct:
- Take a screenshot of every comment targeted for moderation
- If the comment involves a moderator, triage to an uninvolved moderator 
- Delete on sight if the comment is violent, sexually explicit, sharing NCC/PII or other illegal content, or spam
- DM and ask to edit for all other offenses. Delete repeat offenses.
