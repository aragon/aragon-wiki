# What is Aragon?

Aragon is an open-source, community-driven project with the mission to empower freedom by creating tools for decentralized organizations to thrive.

The flagship product of the project is the [Aragon client](https://aragon.org/discover), a tool for creating and participating in decentralized organizations on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org). The project is also building the [Aragon Network](https://aragon.org/network), the world's first digital jurisdiction.

The Aragon project is stewarded by the Aragon Association, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland, and [governed](https://aragon.org/project/governance) by Aragon Network Token holders.
