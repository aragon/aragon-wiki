Help us keep it fun and productive! Be kind and empathic towards each other Assume good intentions Embody the values of the Aragon Manifesto Keep comments on-topic (note that we have a #random channel on Discord for off-topic discussion) All comments in Aragon community forums should be in English to preserve understanding in the community, unless a channel or forum is created specifically for the non-English language you would like to post in. If you would like a channel or forum created for your non-English language, and one does not already exist, please contact a moderator on Discord or the Aragon Forum and ask. Unacceptable behaviors We have a list of unacceptable behaviors. Please familiarize yourself with them before joining the project so you can help us support a healthy community. This is not a complete list, and our moderators have discretion over which comments they moderate. If you try to be the best person you can be when you are in our community spaces, you will probably be okay. Details about how to reach out to moderators with reports or questions can be found below. Ad hominem and other name-calling Stalking or harassment (repeated unwanted contact, including sexual advances) Any sexually or violently explicit content (NSFW) Hate towards people due to their race, gender, sexual preferences, or any other reason Flame wars Sharing or requesting NCC and/or PII (e.g. doxxing) False accusations or accusations without evidence Spam (unsolicited off-topic messages, especially commercial in nature) Inciting or threatening violence, including encouraging others to hurt themselves Repeatedly yelling (i.e. ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation points!!!) Coordinating \u201cpumps\u201d or \u201cdumps\u201d of financial assets or other market manipulation, including excessive shilling Posting content that would be considered illegal in Switzerland Our Responsibilities The Aragon team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. The Aragon team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any community member or contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Reporting If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact moderators through the following channels: Direct message chat moderator @burrrata on Discord Flag any post and/or send a direct message to \u201cmoderators\u201d in the Aragon Forum Report any post and/or send a direct message to the /r/AragonProject subreddit moderators If the person who is harassing you is one of the moderators, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident and triage to another moderator. We will respond as promptly as possible. In order to protect the Aragon team from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we've received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Aragon community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. Scope This Code of Conduct applies to all of Aragon project's spaces, including the Aragon client, Aragon Forum, Discord, Spectrum, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and all other spaces associated with the Aragon project, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Aragon team. Some of the Aragon project's spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules. If you are being harassed by a member of the Aragon community outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Aragon community members seriously. This includes harassment outside of our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The team reserves the right to exclude people from the Aragon community at their discretion, based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Aragon spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Aragon community. Enforcement Moderators will generally follow this standard response protocol for infringements of this Code of Conduct: - Take a screenshot of every comment targeted for moderation. - If the comment involves a moderator, triage to an uninvolved moderator. - Delete on sight if the comment is violent, sexually explicit, sharing NCC/PII or other illegal content, or spam. - DM and ask to edit for all other offenses. Delete repeat offenses.

And Is this repo owned by Aragon One? Repo currently is apps that we have a specific auditing process for, but payroll would require its own audit. Potentially maintenance of payroll app could be done by A1, DAC or Protofire, but currently it\u2019s TBD. Questions about scope important. For now, can potentially work in a fork and do reviews there, and then merge into master on aragon apps when the project is \u201ccomplete\u201d. There could be a validation process when changing the namespace from future-apps. Leo: currently we have own PR on their fork, then review internally. When ready for external review make PR to the main repo (in future apps namespace). Decision: Keep going as is for now, open to changes as we go DAC: documentation and tutorials Chris has started to make small changes that don\u2019t require macro-changes to the hack.aragon.org, currently handled in github. Onboarding another more technical contributor Will start work on full tutorials soon. Can share a doc on the tutorial strategy, likely by end of week. Additionally chris has some macro changes he is proposing that may require structural changes to hack.aragon.org Main thing was moving to a different platform, but doesn\u2019t look like we will be doing that in the short-term. Aragon One deployments Contracts currently deployed on rinkeby are more or less in deprecated state Will be deploying new contracts, including ens resolver on rinkeby Will have two environments: staging, and the official 0.6 instance The official 0.6 instances will be accessible in the same way that 0.5 is currently This rinkeby deployment will be essentially the same as our mainnet deployment, if all goes well, this deployment will be deployed to mainnet the following week. Mainnet will reference the real ENS instance After deployment, any help banging on the release is much appreciated! Future of Aragen Arthur: Seems like this hasn\u2019t been maintained, might not be currently working. Wondering if we should port this functionality into the CLI Jorge: aragon/aragen!15 This pr makes aragen work with latest changes, nearly ready to be merged. Vision for aragen is to have something to that can be downloaded that creates an environment that justs works, currently it is a dependency for the cli, so not sure it can be ported to CLI. Add version support tables As the versioning gets more complicated, seems like it might make sense to have which versions of which pieces of aragon work with which versions of other pieces. Would this be useful? Yes, nice to know what is compatible with what. Makes sense to integrate in documentation, maintain in a repo, where does this make sense? Brett: hack.aragon.org probably the most accessible place. If we had a table on page there it would be quite useful.

Potentially maintenance of payroll app could be done by A1, DAC or Protofire, but currently it\u2019s TBD. Questions about scope important. For now, can potentially work in a fork and do reviews there, and then merge into master on aragon apps when the project is \u201ccomplete\u201d. There could be a validation process when changing the namespace from future-apps. Leo: currently we have own PR on their fork, then review internally. When ready for external review make PR to the main repo (in future apps namespace). Decision: Keep going as is for now, open to changes as we go DAC: documentation and tutorials Chris has started to make small changes that don\u2019t require macro-changes to the hack.aragon.org, currently handled in github. Onboarding another more technical contributor Will start work on full tutorials soon. Can share a doc on the tutorial strategy, likely by end of week. Additionally chris has some macro changes he is proposing that may require structural changes to hack.aragon.org Main thing was moving to a different platform, but doesn\u2019t look like we will be doing that in the short-term. Aragon One deployments Contracts currently deployed on rinkeby are more or less in deprecated state Will be deploying new contracts, including ens resolver on rinkeby Will have two environments: staging, and the official 0.6 instance The official 0.6 instances will be accessible in the same way that 0.5 is currently This rinkeby deployment will be essentially the same as our mainnet deployment, if all goes well, this deployment will be deployed to mainnet the following week. Mainnet will reference the real ENS instance After deployment, any help banging on the release is much appreciated! Future of Aragen Arthur: Seems like this hasn\u2019t been maintained, might not be currently working. Wondering if we should port this functionality into the CLI Jorge: aragon/aragen!15 This pr makes aragen work with latest changes, nearly ready to be merged. Vision for aragen is to have something to that can be downloaded that creates an environment that justs works, currently it is a dependency for the cli, so not sure it can be ported to CLI. Add version support tables As the versioning gets more complicated, seems like it might make sense to have which versions of which pieces of aragon work with which versions of other pieces. Would this be useful? Yes, nice to know what is compatible with what. Makes sense to integrate in documentation, maintain in a repo, where does this make sense? Brett: hack.aragon.org probably the most accessible place. If we had a table on page there it would be quite useful.

How does sol-trace work? A lot of things make sense in the proposal, it\u2019ll be cool to work on these Gabi asked for more comments/feedback as it is a long document AGP-18 Clarification as it affects how we develop: Authio will partner with Consensys Diligence to audit They\u2019ll do a base audit Until the 3 month trial they\u2019ll be advised by Consensys Diligence Security partners working aligned with Aragon One\u2019s roadmap but idea is to work with other teams (Flock and Nest) yet these teams are not ready for audits Important to prioritize Actor App Weekly priority sessions Communications will be private starting out so that nothing leaks (there is responsibility of being invited to this channel) Yalda question: Funding is coming through a DAO. What happens if a vulnerability is found and the funds are lost? Do teams have to create another proposal? Jorge: there is no plan as there are no guarantees if this happens. Aragon One feels confident about the code and that\u2019s why it is being used but there are no guarantees. Another AGP would make sense in case it happens.

How does sol-trace work? A lot of things make sense in the proposal, it\u2019ll be cool to work on these Gabi asked for more comments/feedback as it is a long document AGP-18 Clarification as it affects how we develop: Authio will partner with Consensys Diligence to audit They\u2019ll do a base audit Until the 3 month trial they\u2019ll be advised by Consensys Diligence Security partners working aligned with Aragon One\u2019s roadmap but idea is to work with other teams (Flock and Nest) yet these teams are not ready for audits Important to prioritize Actor App Weekly priority sessions Communications will be private starting out so that nothing leaks (there is responsibility of being invited to this channel) Yalda question: Funding is coming through a DAO. What happens if a vulnerability is found and the funds are lost? Do teams have to create another proposal? Jorge: there is no plan as there are no guarantees if this happens. Aragon One feels confident about the code and that\u2019s why it is being used but there are no guarantees. Another AGP would make sense in case it happens.

Updates Aragon One Finishing up loose ends for 0.7 Work on court Finalizing Payroll - soft launch for 0.7 - will add to the AGP18 Security partners pipeline aragonOS and payroll shoud be pinned be the end of the week. Finished up work for local identities and identity providers - not the entire spec yet, but there is local address book tagging ['local identity']. Will provide details on how to access staging and provide feedback. Court (Jorge). Published the mechanism and open sourced the repo. PoC mechanism almost there.getting appeals process finalized and testing strategy. Still thinking about the testing strategy. Autark On the way to Rinkeby Work on the Address Book. How to articulate Address Book and A1 Identity Provider? Work on responsive design. Will come on second deployment. Improve testing - in the next two weeks should be in a state to have e2e testing for all apps. Bug fixing and improvements in response to the reviews. Major work on Allocations app to change how we handle payouts. Increased the amount of dynamic informative text across all applications so users have a strong idea of what votes, and forwarded actions do. OWL Profiles - going forward with 3Box integration. Finalized plan to move their data structures to adhere to linked data standards. Started developing the Profiles solution this week. Discussions - Built a proof of concept IPFS backend caching layer. Aragon Mesh Updates to aragonCLI in previous two weeks: Add aragon ipfs view & aragon ipfs propagate Renamed kits to templates Planned features for CLI extensions Merged react and react-kit boilerplates The react boilerplate now has linting and testing for the contracts set up, thanks to David from P2P models (who's working on the Aragon Wiki app) The react boilerplate app was updated (Pierre - Aragon One).

Earlier to get security review in processes, the cheaper it will be in the long run Initial findings - havent written a report yet - there are certain security and quality gates already implemented and they are going to suggest more security gates so its easier for new members and for other projects to trust the core system Announcements Aragon 0.7 on staging A1 maintains a staging environment on rinkeby Staging uses a separate ENS instance to the rinkeby release. That means staging DAOs are separate to rinkeby DAOs even though they're on the same network. Tries to deploy every 2 weeks to staging with new changes. Any time a new feature is merged or on the verge of merge, will deploy a staging build to test it out themselves and make it easier for others in the team to test. Not sure about publicizing all builds, but may be a way to get people more involved in testing Reach out if interested in testing the changes or if you know someone that wants to help. Latest version for local Identities and other changes for 0.7 published last week on staging. Pando Released pando on rinkeby last week. See forum post for details: https://forum.aragon.org/t/pando-live-on-rinkeby/712/5 There is a test DAO on rinkeby with onboarding guide on how to use pando. Pando cli is published on npm - anyone can use it and test it on rinkeby, can deploy a test DAO and see if everything is working Deployment process was almost easy except the IPFS aspect. ipfs-propogate command has been a great help There is a problem with the aragon dev chain. cannot publish on open.aragonpm.eth on the devchain The related issue . @aragon/api-react Release Announcement Stable release Pierre over the last few weeks has been working on react api on FE for apps. Using hooks,very modern as far as react exprience goes. It should help people it gradually get into the aragon API aspect of things for front end. Makes things a lot more explicit A1 has started using it internally and will be migrating most of their apps to use this api in the coming \"while\" Discussions Organization identity Widget approach - for a DAO to customize the information they want to include Ability to set a token defining membership. Maybe a more generic approach such as an ENS-based approach could make it to. Jorge: with ENS there are additional advantages. For example with melonport they have two types of members with different permissions. If you have one native token that will have to be the global Ability to create as many info blobs as the organization wants. Based on Markdown Vote-based process to update / change. Need the ability to add manifesto / important text for the DAO. It wont be stored on chain. Ability to create \"word blobs\" via widgets and markdown-based. Integrating a text editor - and ability to vote to change the data. Potentially this is something that could be managed completely by Pando repos. How does it stay on IPFS? Plans on using pinning service (pinata?) Right now using Infura bc they pin automatically but not a great long term solution. IPFS Consortium IPFS Cluster Jorge: for the court the organization needs written rules, manifesto, etc. so it is important for that. Would love to be involved in the process of how this gets done. Ability to provide specific informations about DAOs. Requirements for specific features ? Potential APIs Set a default token manager app Membership hook / abstraction layer in aragonAPI. E.g. as part of the settings \"I would like to use this app as my membership provider\" - then link to token manager for example Implement an app that only \"attaches\" (not \"manages\") a token, for its forwarding interface Aragon Trigger? Forum post soon 3Box API. Few questions / doubts from John: Wondering how they are implementing querying and how that scales Need a good way to identify and access as far as he knows, not an easy way to do that If you're using a backend caching layer each comment has a hash Wondering how their implementation under the hood is actually better than a centralized caching layer Wondering if they are spreading theirselves thin? 3box supposed to tackle identity/profiles They may be taking on too much by doing commenting as well Forwarding UX Improvements https://forum.aragon.org/t/showing-pending-forwarded-actions-in-apps/709 Allow apps to be aware that an action is pending in a forwarder (e.g. into the voting app). Other applications can display that something may potentially happen as a result of voting. eg. you are in finance app and create a new transfer. That creates a new vote, but finance app doesn't have knowledge of that action within the app. Decoding EVMScripts: Decoding will be the most interesting part of how this gets built Information needed to decode the script is probably more accesible in the receiving app vs target app Decoding in two layers: Decode to determine type of EVMScript, and superficial details (e.g. target address) Decode actual target calls via apps' ABIs Decoding is easier if you have only one \"interactive\" forwarder at the end of the path, but gets more complicated if there are more than one (e.g. voting -> voting, voting -> futarchy) UI standarization How much of the information would actually be acted upon int he UIs? Will the application determine which functions are relevant? For example maybe have a badge that displays if an action is protected by an auth guard Perhaps the auth information could be shown in the signing panel Auth information is likely important for other users, not just the creator, so useful in interactive forwarders' UIs too E.g. Voting app: it should be more clear that you will be interacting with a contract or not Could render components from other applications to show more specific information However, this would likely require another iframe to sandbox correctly (which is not nice) Security Requirements If you have any supporting links for high level doc, will be helpful for security partners so they can estimate their budget better for the AGP. Aragon One Completely new code - Full audit vs incremental Network components - court is fairly large contract with many edge cases Staking component - meant to be simple and self contained Bonding curve component - similar to staking. Holds value - lot of care needed. When people want to become jurors this is done with a bonding curve. Incremental change - perhaps a new app for the Aragon client - associated to this app will be a few changes to the Voting app. Controller for the Voting app - pause this vote, cancel this vote. Has specific functionality to enable court features. More details in the blog/forum post. As far as contracts for existing applications - hopefully they wont change hence no audits needed. If they do change it's because something went wrong. Autark Applications that will need full audits at some point: Allocations Range Voting Projects Address Book Rewards The urgency of these audits is not a major pressure currently, ideally we'd like to have these applications published to Mainnet before the end of the year Possible to do audit of each app seperately or in phases to distribute the effort Aragon Black Apiary The overall Apiary app is made of four contracts: * the tap which is pretty simple. * the pool which inherits the Agent app while adding the ability to add a list of guarded token and a safeExecute function checking that the target contract is not a guarded token + that the balance of each guarded token is kept constant before and after the transaction * the bonding curve contract which is the tricky one. * a wrapping Apiary contract behaving as an api contract on top of the three previous contracts to circumvent sandboxing limitations. The tricky part is gonna be the bonding curve contract. The pool contract tricky part is limited to the safeExecute function. The other ones are pretty straightforward and fast to audit I guess. The bonding curve is basically a BancorFormula contract (ideally we would need to review it too, though I guess Bancor contracts are already heavily reviewed) with batched orders to mitigate front running (plus AragonOS features like ACL and all of course). The network bonding curve may rely on this implementation so I may make sense to heavily review it :) Pando If we pass the next AGP ballot and Aragon Black becomes an official Aragon Team - and thus pando an official aragon app - it may makes sense to review the contracts too. Those are pretty simple and straightforward, though so it should not be that much work - an internal review may even be enough.

Where do we want content blocks? IPFS Pinning REST API as well as our own node. Our API can handle requests from clients and pin to node providers. We can pin to multiple additional services. We can store that data in traditional dbs like mongo so we can query and cache data. This still allows for content verifiability. Textile uses developer keys and JWTs. We could use this to help build authentication but needs to fleshed out. Signing messages doesn't prevent ddos. We could look at permissions or ANT levels. Every org has it's own backend and pin files themselves instead of having one large service that serves every organization. We could have this resource at a network level. Could be distributed to flock teams. Filecoin could be integrated into this. Need to look into ethereum-filecoin integrations. See in-progress implementation: openworklabs/pinning-service .

We can store that data in traditional dbs like mongo so we can query and cache data. This still allows for content verifiability. Textile uses developer keys and JWTs. We could use this to help build authentication but needs to fleshed out. Signing messages doesn't prevent ddos. We could look at permissions or ANT levels.

We could have a Twitter account for the Aragon dev tools. We could use multiple channels: Rocket.chat, micro blog post, forum, Twitter, GitHub releases. For now: use Twitter and Rocket.chat, for people who would like to follow the updates on Github, they can use the \"watch releases\" functionality Aragon Design system Started as a visual refresh, evolved into a new design system for Aragon. Presentation by Paty: introduction to design systems and w hy it is needed for Aragon. Collection of rules constraints and principles for design in Aragon We could define a governance model for this design system (quality criteria, roles, production stages). Aragon One started creating guidelines about how to create design and components specifications. Overview of the recent design work by the Aragon One design team. New colors set, more consistent, semantic and accessible. Base grid unit of 8x8px. Everything is now based on this unit. New Layout: introduce a maximum width, improve responsiveness by making it work at any size (move from fully fluid to semi-rigid layout). Fix the spacing in general. All the different components are included in this new system, including their states. New icon set, using the new grid unit. More consistency. The list is still small, but we would like to expand it based on the needs of the different Flock teams. Showcasing refreshed apps: App Center, Token Manager, Voting.

Allowing a DAO to pay for their members' txs. Avoids too many changes to existing Aragon Apps as the signer is appended to the calldata, but the gas fees might become a little steeper. Is there another better way? Two PRs up on this topic on aragon/os These two features will prob be landing in aragonOS 5.

Current priorities Iterate on the IPFS command for stability Better feedback whne fetching a file and better error messages Create a DAO to experiment with AGP 28 and aragon package manager governance. Aragon Black Pando: refactored background scripts to fetch the IPLD data to comply with their new spec Finished tests with that as well Implemented frontend markdown editing - shoutout @OTTO for coordinating some of that work. Lingering question, since we're using similar deps to actually do the markdown editing, should we get this into aragon/ui? Apiary (aka aragon fundraising app): frontend is basically done, responsive, filtering of orders and chart history, just needs minor refactoring to make the code clean Might need final feedback on the design but the current design is good enough for this iteration Market maker contract is now ready, there's only 1 thing left (to do with fees on sell orders) Up and coming audit scheduled from june 10 to july 1 Getting the kit working and also looking into how they can get onboarding screens for the kit. After that, working on web3 integration - making the frontend work with the smart contracts. Aragon Association Short update: Planning the audit for Apiary Treasury is up from 22m to 60m which is awesome Nest has been approving for second nest grant - there are some new proposals, go take a look and give feedback #161 and #162 Discussions Dev tools comms channel (John Light) Conclusion from last call: use twitter + rocket.chat for dev tool release announcements. People who would like to follow up on the updates can use the watch releases functionality on github. Seems reasonable - topic has come up several times - historically for external communication is to tweet from maintainer (individual tweet or thread). Aragon project will retweet that from aragon account. This gets more visilibity into this release People look on twitter there for aragon related news Another thing is rocket chat - the maintainer might do an @all channel message in the appropriate channel to announce the release How have release communications been working for maintainers so far? Is it adequate? Do you need/want more visibility? If we do want more visibility, what new channels can we use to promote new releases aragon/ui , aragon/cli , aragonpm - do they need to expand to the ethereum ecosystem, do they need more open source contributors? Maintainers / release strategy right now is done on a per repo basis - no standard. aragon/cli is the highest priority for communications because it's one of the first touch points Perhaps we could have smaller stability releases and then larger feature releases. Make more noise when the functionality releases land (new commands, new features...etc). Can be done doing a Twitter thread. Coordinate with John on release day for some communication to be put out. John is open to coordinate with any maintainer to communicate more about dev updates Gabi was implementing a system for bounties on the cli and they tested the first bounties they are calling for collaboration on that, also for the bounty standard definition details. Gitcoin is a pain to manage due to bounties being locked to one account Gitcoin started charging 10% - instead go with TPS! Brett suggests making a micro-site to promote these bounties related things. Collaborating on Aragon client (Jon / A1) Even a large PR should make sense The concern is being synced to master branch Yalda and Jon point to profiles integration design compatible with the next top-navigation bar release Sync with @luis on feature spec, start migrating work to aragon/aragon but hidden behind a feature flag Forwarding API Testing this week, should be ready for aragon/api non-beta version. Autark could submit the PR today... Haven't tested setting it up in an actual application yet - that is the next step Basic pattern \u2192 new forwarded action in the api, and an observable for updated forwarded actions in the api Concerns: storing state, which wasn't in the initial spec. Persisting executed actions so that the information is still accessible. Ready to make changes if it doesn't work or adhere to spec correctly Event caching changes might change this forwarder API? Conclusion - see the PR sooner Helpful to see what's going on and make decisions Idea now: keep going on towards betas until 0.8 release and know for sure that we don't need another breaking change in the future (or at least for this iteration round for the API) Next steps: submit a PR. Questions: UI Design patterns: needs another look. What should it look like? Can we establish a good visual pattern across applications? Might not be consistent across all apps? - yalda One use case: allocation. Right now allocations app, there is already a table on the bottom of different allocation proposals - what's missing - \"pending a vote\". Coming up with terminology and diff icons for what things means, states...etc Issue curation / funding: those are use cases that are a little different. There's nowhere in the projects app that displays these proposals. Another design that's being worked on now. Initial designs finished by tomorrow Activity panel - quite confusing with forwarded actions. Activity panel doesn't tell you very much about what's actually happening. Deep links within aragon apps If you can click on an a pending action and it takes you to the forwarded location on the other app where that action is pending Main problem is how to figure out app routing, and how to send these params down between apps aragon/api has a context api that hasn't been used (ever), but it was meant to do this type of thing. Mostly its the aragon client not wiring together navigation between URL params and the app context There's some potential to use context API for something like this, or to completely start a new navigation API Next steps: sync between Otto, Kevin, Pierre on how this API could look like Markdown editor in aragonUI Existing renderer in the client How do we go about standardizing markdown text editor/display?

Aragon Mesh Nest update, and with this occasion we've been reviewing and formatting our releases which were aggregated in a CHANGELOG.md file We marked 3 versions as stable: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-cli/#stable-builds- Made some progress with AGP-28 (the DAOfication of aragonpm.eth ) Nightly build: - Set up probot apps & switched to dependabot from greenkeeper for dependency management. - Added a new option called --apm.ipfs.gateway , which is used to download application artifacts from.

John: There use to be documentation inside of the wiki; since then our documentation is on HelpScout (paid 3 rd party service @ help.aragon.org). Useful tool for seperating documentation between different apps with links, but poses a challenge because of the paywall around accounts. Is it scalable to coordinate a guest account / onboarding process for new developers. Should app developers host their own documentation for apps or should we include all documentation in a centralized location. Daniel: We have more than just technical documentation but also a user-guide for Fundraising / pando. Would like to add video content as well. Creating a blog / platform for different verticals Yalda: the forwarding flow makes the separation between apps important; it should be easy for a user to understand all the different apps in-between, especially if they're from different developers Different doc sites would get really confusing Brett: HelpScout could be for OS-level functionality, but docs should be maintained per app by their developers Daniel / Louis: Perhaps we could have a template / centralized location for the docs Token manager strategy for \"quasi-transferable tokens\" [Autark] MiniMe token with whitelist transferablility, so in order to support roles for this implementation we need to have a permissioned function in the token manager.

Louis: We should think about the association creating the proposal and then finiding a team that can take on that work. Or we can wait until a Flock team has the bandwidth to take on this project. Possibly A1 or AB can find reasons to put this on their roadmaps given the apps they are supporting currently. Reach out if anyone has an idea on how to implement IPFS pinning with Pinata Similar to last topic, looking to spark interest in integrating the Pinata pinning service (up to 1GB). Jonathan: Curious if their endpoint is compatible with the IPFS API (Avoid refactoring). How do we manage the API keys with DAOs (governance questions: does the entity have its own or do the members generate their own etc.) Brett: You can share keys between the members and we utilize local storage. Pinata would just act as a way to host these files peristently, especially if we set the Cloudflare IPFS gateway as our default gateway for interactions with IPFS.

Based on feedback, decided to open two new positions on the development team -- will be posted soon. Know of people excited - send them their way. UX/React position web3 position Fundraising Addressing audit for the Fundraising contracts. The market maker contract is the more detailed one to resolve.

Deam has been working with Paty and Pierre to implement the latest design system. Background scripts: new member is picking it up The roadmap for now: rinkeby version published by early August.

There's another AGP to review regarding transitioning the Nest to be a DAO. Discussions Updating app parameters from the UI Something that could be discussed at a Flock level as far as setting standards for how app parameters are managed in the UI Note: modifying parameters has not yet been implemented in the cli (although you can use dao exec to change them) A1's thoughts: have been toying with the idea of having a \"settings\" app where you can see application-specific settings all grouped under a single location. Haven't gone too far down this road yet, but the design team is working on solidifying it after 0.8 Merge Pool into Agent Aragon Black has been working on Pool contract for the Fundraising app. Working on a safeExecute() function which is similar to the execute() function. Wondering if it makes sense to merge the pool app into the Agent app, as at the end of the day, it is an upgrade of the Agent app. Brett agrees \"there's no reason someone would install the agent app if they had the pool app\". The question is how we go about doing this -- should we wait a bit longer for some specs to solidify (EIP 1271 on signature signing). If EPI 1271 is not close to being done at all, we should just merge the two - Jorge agrees. By Wednesday the app will be done -- up to Aragon One to decide the path forward, but would need it published by August to rinkeby to stay in sync with the Fundraising app roadmap. Needs to ensure it is backwards compatible. UX question: would it confuse people that it's called the \"pool\" in the documentation. Should it be called agent instead? What does the frontend look like? There is no UI or frontend dedicated to the pool. The strategy was to wait for the Agent to have a frontend then to copy it. (See frontend designs for Agent here: https://www.figma.com/file/P35b0ZnTQAIbObM3yB3HosHm/Agent?node-id=0%3A1 ) The Fundraising frontend always has information of what is stored in the pool; Fundraising can operate independently without users actually interfacing with the Agent.

How to organize best as flock teams? Could be interesting to create ownerships for different Aragon repos, with different flock teams owning different repos, and being responsible for reviewing and merging incoming PRs for these repos. Brett details: aragon organization on GH is very A1-specific Transitioned it to one that includes no private repos This org on GH is meant to house all official/shared repos across the whole project (flock, nest, etc) On todo list: defining more specifically the ownership, as well as default permissions Bad right now: the default org permissions are quite open; these need audit before it's practical to add all flock & nest teams Want to make sure \"who gets assigned reviewer responsibility\" and whatnot all makes sense Do flock teams want more permissions here? what setup would people want? Olivier: Problem/issue/discussion: who formally owns what in the stack? Knowing this can ease coordination challenges. Some Aragon-wide things hosted by aragonblack org right now that would benefit from the visibility of being hosted by aragon org instead Brett: What repos would we like to see in the aragon organization (Fundraising could be one of them) Louis: We will continue thinking and discussing this aragonPM Org and Goveranance Structure Should Flock teams have their own ENS subdomains within Aragon? (aragonblack.aragonpm.eth, autark.aragonpm.eth, etc) Olivier: It doesn't make practical sense to have a vote for every small change Brett: We can give permission to other teams to make upgrades in their own repos as they like. The association is the ultimate keyholder and can revoke access to teams if needed Olivier: can we bypass need for a vote for minor updates, but require for major? Brett: no way to do that now What criteria to promote apps to main aragonpm.eth?

Main focus: having power user be at the center of new aragonCLI version. Proposal will include documentation for new users as well as this new power user topic. Aragon Black Fundraising frontend almost done Taking the week to test everything; should be ok Last step is to wait for audit feedback; there's been a miscommunication issue there; had trouble booking the audit They're doing the audit now Only half of the audit, though Discussed with Brett; think the best strategy is to await this half-audit then deploy to Rinkeby Wait until full audit/report complete to fully release to mainnet Rinkeby release to be done before Devcon Final audit & mainnet release to follow Aragon Association Hiring; finding right candidate for ops & hybrid role. Please send recommendations! Starting process for launching Nest DAO. In-progress. Expect more communications about this. Coordinating for security audit for releases (Aragon Black's & Autark's) Updating the wiki to give increased transparency to current & future members of the ecosystem Lots of interesting discussions in the forum ( one , two , three ) Next two weeks: Devcon Discussions Template Contracts going through audit Frontend PR submitted Frontend Triggers This relates to a change under review for the aragon.js repo . Autark needs this change to restore functionality to their Projects & Rewards apps after the v0.8 client update. If needed, Autark can make changes with direction on the architecture from Brett: Route these trigger observables through a specific app context as opposed to inside the root of the wrapper Open Enterprise Release Requirements The plan is to get aragon.js changes for the FE triggers on rinkeby.aragon.org early/mid-week so we can start our community test/bounty program. Onboarding FE template done and PR submitted into aragon/aragon; need to integrate it with the contract which is going through testing. Targeting Friday Oct 4 or Monday/Tue Oct \u215e for mainnet soft launch. Worst case scenario is crunching through Devcon and mainnet Oct 11. The AddressBook IdentityProvider integration is important for doing a bigger launch announcement, but we plan to soft launch next week to reduce the pressure on last minute PRs (as we were previously told there wouldn't be time to get this merged before Devcon). The integration is currently under internal review within Autark . Devcon dinner A bunch of people from Aragon community will be at Devcon. Let's have dinner together! Louis will help coordinate. If you're interested, please ping Louis or Jorge. This will be organized offline. Strategy for integrating aragon profile into the client What Jon thinks might be best: Profiles are at a pretty good place to merge in a soft- / not-public-launch sort of way. Almost like an Easter egg. It's currently integrated very lightly; clicking your user address in the new 0.8 client brings you to your profile. That's it. There are other gateways we could start to implement: in the address pop-over, we could add a \"go to profile\" link. We could add 3box as a full IdentityProvider so we can resolve names and avatars. There's also a question of design: Paty created some great-looking new designs; not sure the timeline for porting to these new designs, but we might not need to do that before initial soft-launch. We spent a long time getting Profiles to this point; it might make sense to merge it now and get some initial user feedback before continuing to polish this PR. Do we want to do this, or do we want to make sure we add particular functionality before reviewing & merging? Next version of aragonCLI Do we want a users-version of the CLI and a dev-version of the CLI?

There are other gateways we could start to implement: in the address pop-over, we could add a \"go to profile\" link. We could add 3box as a full IdentityProvider so we can resolve names and avatars. There's also a question of design: Paty created some great-looking new designs; not sure the timeline for porting to these new designs, but we might not need to do that before initial soft-launch. We spent a long time getting Profiles to this point; it might make sense to merge it now and get some initial user feedback before continuing to polish this PR.

The decision to redesign the DApp was simple. There was a need to align the app and it\u2019s updated graphical identity, design principles and use cases to the origin of the project. Exciting! Team Interviews: Alexa, Aragon\u2019s Operations Assistant Alexa took the leap into the blockchain world and isn\u2019t looking back Today our Team Interview is with Alexa, Aragon\u2019s new Operations Assistant\u2014 we discussed what brought her to work in the blockchain space and why did she choose to work on Aragon. Thoughts On Governance and Network Effects This post discusses governance and its impact on network effects and why both relate to how value flows and is captured within tokenized blockchain networks. Team Interviews: Brett, Aragon\u2019s EVM Engineer Brett is the most recent wizard to join the team This Team Interview focuses on Brett, Aragon\u2019s new EVM/Solidity Engineer\u2014 how he came to work at Aragon, what he thinks of Ethereum and the decentralization movement as well as what this coding wizard uses in his work set up. Introducing Aragon Nest A grants program to support the development of the ecosystems To help support the ecosystem flourish, we are introducing, together with Placeholder \u200a\u2014\u200alead by Joel Monegro and Chris Burniske \u200a\u2014\u200aa grants program called Aragon Nest . Team Interviews: John, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead John joins the team as the new Community Lead John Light has been involved in the cryptocurrency scene for years and we really want to give him a warm welcome from everyone in the team! In this interview he will share his reflections on Ethereum and on how he came to work at Aragon with some fresh ideas which he intends to bring to life soon. November Aragon Team Update: November 2017 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting. Aragon Q3 Transparency Report A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q3 2017 As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Team Interviews: Pierre, Aragon\u2019s Frontend Developer I interviewed Pierre about how he came to work at Aragon, his thoughts on the future of Ethereum and tips for aspiring developers and teams Another new member has joined the team! Pierre is a Frontend Developer that will help the team in fulfilling the Aragon vision. We talked about his experience as a software developer making beautiful user experiences, his thoughts on Ethereum, what tools he uses and what tips he has for aspiring developers and teams working in the space. October Team Interviews: Luke, Aragon\u2019s Research Lead Luke and I talked about how he got involved with Ethereum and Aragon as well as what he sees that the future holds for them Our team has grown and gained a new member again! Today we\u2019re introducing Luke as a new addition. We discussed how he got into working on Ethereum and Aragon, what his vision of their future is and what he\u2019s most excited about getting to work on. Aragon Q3 Development Update This quarter we have been hard at work developing the new v0.5 release . This release paves the way for Aragon to be an extendable governance tool which supports all possible use cases. It has required an immense amount of changes, including a re-architecturing called aragonOS Aragon Chat is now open Aragon starts using the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat We\u2019re happy to inform you that the migration to Rocket Chat is now complete. All users and public channels have been migrated over to the new platform, so feel free to jump in and join the conversation! To use the new Aragon Chat, you can connect directly via the web page or download one of the clients available for Rocket Chat and point it to https://aragon.chat Introducing aragonOS: Say hi to modular and extendable organizations Aragon\u2019s new exokernel-inspired architecture aragonOS smart contract architecture is based on the idea of an organization being the aggregate of multiple components (called applications ) and a pillar that is the Kernel , which governs how these applications can talk to each other and how other entities can interact with them. September Aragon will be Community Governed What community governance really entails Since the inception of the project, Aragon\u2019s vision has been to be open source software and to give power over it to the people who use it. The whole platform will be a community effort\u200a\u2014\u200aand it will take time to build it as envisioned. Right now we are a community based project and our long-term plan is to be a community governed project. To learn why this has been our vision for the project, where we are at the moment and how we plan on achieving our goals, let\u2019s take a look into the history and definition of these terms Announcing Our Migration To An Open Source Messaging Platform Aragon will migrate to Rocket Chat along with 10 other Ethereum projects Today we are announcing the plan of several Ethereum based projects to migrate to the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat. Aragon will be migrating our community out of Slack and onto Rocket Chat in the next couple of weeks. This has been a joint effort from the projects participating in the migration plan. Aragon initially started the proposal for the community after there had already been discussion on the subject from multiple projects. We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects. August Why Transparency Matters Aragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon\u2019s new Transparency Framework At Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community\u200a\u2014\u200asupporters, contributors and token holders\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner. The community is very important to us, they are the ones that we\u2019re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing. This is why we\u2019re showcasing our model for doing things transparently. This all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report. We\u2019ll now present you with all the different methods we\u2019re employing. The parts of our project\u2019s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework. Token Buyback Transparency Report Why did we buy back ANT and how we will disclose these events Today, adhering to our high transparency standards, we\u2019re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why we\u2019re reporting our token buybacks. In our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we\u2019ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we\u2019ll use our funds for. July Aragon Network Jurisdiction Part 1: Decentralized Court When first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it. Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation. Our solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service. The emergent Ethereum stack district0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack Software allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building. At Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing. So, generally speaking, we don\u2019t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we\u2019re indirectly funding its further development. That\u2019s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible. Aragon\u2019s Community Governance Model How we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community Our community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens. Two weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it. Further changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we\u2019ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion. The model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent. Introducing Mihai Alisie as an Advisor Why him, why now and the road ahead We announced two of our Advisors before the successful ANT sale. Kenny Rowe from the MakerDAO project and Jake Brukhman of CoinFund. Both experts in their fields and respected members of the Ethereum community. While we did have our Board of Advisors in place before the token sale, we chose not to disclose all the members then. Aragon Q2 Development Update v0.4 release status and the road ahead We will be delivering regular updates on the development of Aragon. This is our first quarterly update to bring the community up to speed on where we\u2019re at and the road ahead. June Team Interviews: Mar\u00eda, Aragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations Mar\u00eda shares her thoughts about Aragon and what got her into working on an Ethereum based project As a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Mar\u00eda\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about her, her interest in Ethereum, how she came to work, and her role, at Aragon. Aragon to power the district0x Network Welcoming district0x to the Aragon Network Jurisdiction Today, we are pleased to introduce the first resident of the Aragon Network Jurisdiction, the district0x Network The district0x Network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities powered by Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS. Markets on the network, also referred to as districts, are all built upon a shared framework comprised of smart contracts and front-end libraries which provide the functionality necessary to operate communal marketplaces which are similar to services like AirBNB, eBay, Uber, or Reddit with payments. Aragon partners with 0x Making decentralized organizations go beyond Ether So today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with 0x to allow Aragon organizations to accept and operate with any token. 0x is a protocol for decentralized exchange on Ethereum allowing users to exchange tokens without a central broker\u200a\u2014\u200aending the many inefficiencies of centralization by enabling transparent token exchanges between contracts. Team Interviews: Tatu, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead Tatu talks about why he is part of the Ethereum community and why he is so enthusiastic about Aragon and decentralization As part of our team interview series (Luis\u2019 Interview|Jorge\u2019s Interview), I\u2019ve interviewed Tatu\u2014 Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about his experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, the projects he\u2019s most excited about, and why he chose to work for Aragon. May Announcing the ENS Aragon Network Company Registry With Aragon, we set out to create software that makes it easy to create and run decentralized organizations. However, meaningless ETH addresses made sending funds and completing transactions for operating a business unnecessarily complicated. Fortunately, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) recently solved this issue by enabling the assignment of human-readable names to eth addresses. This was important for the entire Ethereum ecosystem (including Aragon)\u2014 no longer do you have to send transactions to a series of numbers and letters. So today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we won the bid for the name company.eth! In this post, we\u2019ll explain how Aragon organizations will use the name and the implications for Aragon Network user-adoption. The Aragon Token Sale: The Numbers Roughly $25 million was collected in 26 minutes. The rate was $122k/s the first 3 blocks. Yesterday, we closed the 4 th largest crowdfunding event in history, and the 2 nd largest in the blockchain space (after The DAO). Raising 275,000 ether, or roughly $25 million, we\u2019re incredibly humbled by the support of the community and the trust in our mission to make decentralized autonomous organizations widespread. In this post, we\u2019d like to reflect on the last 48 hours, provide some data on the sale, and most importantly express our gratitude to the community. Final token sale recap Please read How to Securely Participate in the sale for information and tutorials on how to participate. Pre-Sale Transparency Report Before tomorrow\u2019s token sale, we believe it\u2019s important that we release a transparency report about the pre-sale. This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used. Aragon Token Sale Contracts Have Been Deployed and Activated ANT sale begins on Ethereum mainnet\u2019s block 3,723,000\u200a\u2014\u200aMay 17, ~6pm GMT How to Participate in the Sale Wait for block 3,723,000 (May 17 at approximately 6pm GMT). You can check what the latest block is on Etherscan. After block 3,722,999 has been mined, it is safe to send the transaction. Note that sending the transaction before that block is mined will result in a loss of fees. Send ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network Send at least 200,000 gas with your transaction. If your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized. Introducing the Aragon Community Multisig A \u2157 multisig that will approve the deployment of the Aragon Network The Aragon Network Token (ANT) will initially begin as an upgradable token, but will evolve to serve as the governance token for the Aragon Network when deployed. We estimate that the Aragon Network will be deployed in May of 2018. Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack. However, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token? Token sale cap clarification tl;dr: Our cap is not $100m, or near that amount We have had a lot of questions about our hidden cap mechanism. Since it\u2019s pretty new to the token sale world, we understand the confusion and want to provide a simple breakdown to clarify. Token Sale Audit Results No Critical Issues Reported and Token Sale is On-Schedule To ensure a stable and safe token sale, we employed the help of Jordi Baylina and Piper Merriam to perform independent audits of Aragon token sale contract code. Jordi and Piper completed their reports this week and published their independent findings (Jordi\u2019s Report | Piper\u2019s Report). No critical issues were reported in either independent audit. And for the issues that were found, we\u2019ve worked closely with Jordi and Piper to resolve them and improve the code. In addition, we\u2019re happy to announce that there have been no critical issues reported through the bug bounty program. Thanks to all of those that have participated, and note that the bug bounty program will continue indefinitely. Announcing the Aragon Advisors Kenny from MakerDAO and Jake from CoinFund will be advising Aragon We are pleased to announce two people that we really admire in the Ethereum community will be joining us as advis0rs: Kenny Rowe and Jake Brukhman. Open Sourcing Aragon Making Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon When I was 12, I got my first laptop\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn\u2019t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming. The free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon. So when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We\u2019ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it. How to Securely Participate in the Aragon Token Sale Using Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask The ANT token sale is happening on May 17 th ! In anticipation, we\u2019ve been and will continue to frequently post about Aragon and sale details. In this post, we list the sources to trust for ANT sale information, and provide instructions for purchasing with Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask. Aragon On Tour: Meetups Around the Globe Come to one of our meetups, have a beer with us and talk decentralized awesomeness On the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. This has been extremely beneficial for the development of communities around the world, and crypto is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples. But who doesn\u2019t like to have a beer with people that share common interests? It\u2019s part of our human nature! So aside from being on Slack all day and night, we\u2019ve organized a series of meetups for Ethereum & Aragon enthusiasts to get together to talk about exciting projects and have a few drinks! Aragon Tutorial: Raising funds with a token How you can raise capital creating your own token in a few clicks Token sales are changing the rules of the game, making it extremely easy for anyone in the world to gather capital and build new products. With Aragon, you can create token sales in a few clicks and publish the sale address so everyone can participate. Our Public Product Roadmap and Issue Reporting Enhancing transparency in product development Often, product and software development is secretive and confidential until the official product launch. While this has the effect of building excitement, it can lead to unrealistic user expectations, development of products that are missing key features, and ultimately products that miss end-user needs. As a result, we believe it\u2019s important to engage the community throughout the product development process\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what we\u2019ve done while developing Aragon. The community has consistently provided valuable feedback and unique perspectives. From user interface design to our token model, feedback from the Aragon community has guided Aragon Core and Network development. Aragon token sale bug bounty We\u2019re excited to announce that we are conducting a bug bounty in advance of the Aragon Network Token sale. We believe bug bounties are essential to ensuring a safe release, and are especially important when cryptocurrency is being exchanged. This post will provide more details on our bug bounty program scope, the timeline, and compensation. Aragon Tutorial: Tokens and voting How you can easily create your own token and govern your organization with it From the beginning, we wanted Aragon to be a tool that anyone can use. So we put a lot of thought into making things easy. To make things even easier, we are starting a series of short videos that explain every part of Aragon. Our Intended Use of Revenue How we plan to use the token sale to drive development As previously announced, the Aragon Network Token (ANT) sale will be conducted on May 17 th . The funds raised will fund Aragon Core development and the Network deployment. The specific steps and timeline to make Aragon production ready are outlined in our development plan, released last week. In this post, we\u2019re excited to provide details on our intended use of revenue from the token sale. April Aragon + Status: Bringing decentralized organizations everywhere Getting ready to offer Aragon to 2.3bn smartphone users Our mission at Aragon is to make decentralized organizations widespread. To achieve our mission, we built a dApp to easily create and operate decentralized organizations on Ethereum. First, we focused on building a feature rich web and desktop (including MacOS, Linux, and Windows) application. But our initial focus ignored a major way that over 2.3 billion people interact with applications today: their smartphones. The reason we ignored these users was simple\u200a\u2014\u200athe development effort to create mobile applications is significant and would distract from developing fully featured web and desktop versions. A note for exchanges or holders interacting with ANT in an automated manner The Aragon Network Token has vesting built in that limits the transferability of the token until a specified time. Aragon Token Sale Technical Overview TL;DR: ANT is a MiniMe Token with built-in vesting functionality. Two security audits are currently being performed and a bug bounty will begin soon. ANT contract code is live on Github. This post will discuss the ANT base token and its functionality, the ANT sale contract, and the current state of ANT security and future efforts to ensure a successful token sale. The path to mainstream decentralized organizations Yesterday, we published our development plan for Aragon Core and the Aragon Network. This post explains in greater detail our structure to store and allocate funds from Aragon Network Token (ANT) sales, features of the next Aragon Core release, and plans to deploy the Aragon Network and its first organizations. Introducing the Aragon Development Plan The road ahead to make decentralized organizations widespread Last week, we announced our token sale and its terms. Today, we will be addressing the future of Aragon, by releasing our Development Plan. Aragon Network Token sale terms Founder vesting, simple pricing and distribution Yesterday we announced the Aragon Network Token sale. Today, we will go into its details. For a simple overview of the sale in just one page, download the one pager. Announcing the Aragon Network Token sale ANT sale starts on May 17 th . Bootstrapping the creation of the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction. We have been asked countless times about whether we would do a token sale or not. Our answer always was: if it makes sense, we will! After launching Aragon, we spent a lot of time talking to people and thinking. What will be the main issues to make decentralized organizations widespread? Team Interviews: Luis, Aragon\u2019s Project Lead Luis talks about why he is creating Aragon and his long-term vision for it I have interviewed my cofounder Luis\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Project Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the future of the project, and his long term vision. Introducing the Aragon Network Solving the biggest hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread Our first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize our vision. Those main hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread are upgradeability and decentralized arbitration. The 8 pillars of any organization A walk-through of Aragon and the why behind each feature When we set out to create Aragon, we researched what were the core features that an organization needs. Last year, the 11 th of November, we came up with the first version of the product full spec. Most of the features that you see today in Aragon, as well as how they are structured, were laid out that month. Since we have been asked a few times which was our thought process to came up with that features, I\u2019ll go through it. Team Interviews: Jorge, Aragon\u2019s Tech Lead Jorge talks about what excites him the most about Aragon, and the road ahead I have interviewed my cofounder Jorge\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Tech Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the Ethereum community, his workspace and the road ahead. Decentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems Disintermediating human trade\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness\u200a\u2014\u200ais the first step towards a more fair world We take most power for granted. After all, humans enforce most of their social contracts by giving away some freedom. We usually think about intermediaries in a microscopic scale. We think about the guy who delivered us a package. Or the agency we hired to find us a buyer for an apartment. Yet those intermediaries are insignificant compared to the macro-scale intermediaries. March The Governance Release, Alpha 0.3 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f Bring your token, new bylaws, web version and more Tokens are changing the rules of the game. We don\u2019t need to think about obscure business models anymore. We can align our users\u2019 incentives with ours and release a token that implements that logic. At Aragon we believe that we are at the dawn of this token model. And we want to help the community in this journey. So today, we are introducing ERC20 token support for Aragon. Releasing Aragon Alpha \ud83d\ude80 One month ago, we introduced our vision of how companies and organizations will work. And we set to make it a reality. Today, I want to personally thank all the community for the warmest welcome we could have ever dreamed of for Aragon. Advanced Solidity code deployment techniques This is a continuation post to the work we did with Zeppelin for the article on Proxy libraries for code upgradeability. Reading that post is not required in order to understand this one, but it is definitely a recommended read, as the ideas are pretty much on the same line. And towards the end we will combine them. Electron + MetaMask = Secure, Easy to Use Dapps \ud83d\udd12 Sandboxing Ethereum DApps with Electron When we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability. Of course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask\u2026) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience. Since we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found. How Aragon approaches identity and the Ethereum Keybase Resolver Identity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing. February Library Driven Development in Solidity A comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries Introducing Aragon: Unstoppable companies Today, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon. Aragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum. Aragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.

Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it. Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world.

Aragon @ DevCon4 Recap CENTRALIZATION IS STRENGTH Every DevCon is special. But this one was especially special to Aragon. We had most of the team in Prague for the occasion, several of whom also attended the wonderfully organized #CryptoLife hackathon and the Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians Council of Prague in the days preceding the annual Ethereum family reunion. At this year\u2019s DevCon, we were out to share the good news: Aragon is bringing DAOs back, mainnet style. October Aragon 0.6 is live on Mainnet Decentralized organizations just got real. Using Aragon 0.6, named Alba, you can now create Aragon organizations on the Ethereum Mainnet. This is a new era for human collaboration. New kinds of organizations that we haven't even dreamed of before can be now created. Flock, funding for Aragon teams The next step in decentralizing Aragon's development. Earlier this year we set the path for decentralizing Aragon's development. And, after half a year, our vision is already a reality. There are two teams working on Aragon's development already: Aragon One and Aragon DAC. Aragon Nest: Third round of grants Five new teams have been awarded grants with funding from the Aragon Project. The Nest grants program has introduced rounds one and two with the first teams. We now have five more teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project. What does governance mean An intro to the principles of governance. Every collective action whether it is a small group or a vast nation-state follows a governance process. Sometimes this process is formalized, well-documented, and rigid. Other times it is so fluid and informal that it is difficult to observe. The purpose of this post is not to prescribe or analyze any specific process or method for governing, as governance is contextual. Instead, I want to describe a framework for thinking about the power dynamics associated with a governance process, and explore why its important to decentralize governance by establishing processes which prevent or mitigate the ability for power to concentrate and subvert the process at the expense of the organization as a whole. Deprecation notice for v0.5 Rinkeby DAOs Existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby to be deprecated after Oct. 28 th . Since the launch of Aragon Core v0.5 on the Rinkeby testnet this March, the Aragon One development team has been continually improving and battle testing the smart contracts that form the bedrock of over 2500 test organizations. However, as we progress toward a Mainnet launch, it's time to start bringing the latest technology to decentralized organizations. To do this, on October 29, 2018, we will upgrade Aragon Core to version 0.6 on Rinkeby. This new version will include contracts that are not backwards-compatible with the existing v0.5 organizations. As part of the upgrade, we will also be deploying a new ENS registry that will reset the organization names available on aragonid.eth. As a result, any existing test organizations deployed on Rinkeby will be deprecated on Oct. 29, 2018. Aragon Nest Update\u2014Evolution of the grants program The Nest program has been up and running for 7 months already. It's mature enough to make a high level analysis of the program so far and talk a bit about its future. Nest is the grants program run by the Aragon Association (formerly the Aragon Foundation). The process is public and transparent. The Aragon One team was the only team managing it and deciding who and what gets funded up until now. Currently, the Aragon DAC, the new Aragon team, is also participating in the application process. The idea is that all the different Aragon teams will have a part to play in this grants program. Nest Team Interviews: Prysmatic Labs The third of our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is with Prysmatic Labs who are building an Ethereum sharding client. With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. Announcing AraCon \u2014 The Aragon Conference Today we\u2019re announcing the first Aragon Conference \u2014 AraCon.

Pando, when complete, will be a big step towards decentralization of development for all. Building a decentralized OS How we built an Ethereum operating system that is upgradeable, secure and easy to use The general concept goes as follows: You wouldn't want a Tetris app to own full control over your RAM. That would enable tampering with other apps or stealing precious information. Similarly, you wouldn't want a CryptoKitties app to have full control over the funds of your DAO. The role of the OS is to impose a rule system to not let that happen. Nest Team Interviews: That Planning Suite The first one on our Aragon Nest Team Interviews is That Planning Suite who are working on an open source incentivization app. With this series, we want to bring forth the teams that have received a grant and funding from the Aragon Nest grants program. That Planning Suite was the first team accepted into the program and we're all thrilled to see their suite of apps becoming a part of the Aragon ecosystem. Aragon at ETHBerlin Hey, hey, heeey!

August Aragon Labs Research Update #1 Latest news from the Aragon Research & Development department, Labs Our research efforts are on exploring how to realize the lofty ambition of becoming a decentralized, digital jurisdiction. Both the scope and range of services a jurisdiction could offer to attract its constituency are vast and worth exploring. The single most crucial consideration right now is how it will be governed. With effective governance processes we can create new tools for the community. Tools to create new services, or replace or alter existing services, as required to make organizations more effective.

With those plans in mind we want to share with the community the progress of the first batch of the teams funded. The challenges they have faced, and the milestones they have accomplished. We plan to have the teams do these public updates every quarter. One of the key differentiators of the Nest program has always been transparency.

On this second update we announce the four new teams that have been granted funding by the Aragon Project.

Earlier we told that first round of audits was underway and today we are also publishing the results of that audit! Aragon DAC, a new community effort to foster Aragon's development led by Giveth The Aragon Foundation and Giveth are proud to announce the launch of Aragon DAC, a Decentralized Altruistic Community on the Giveth platform that will work on building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective You might know by now that Aragon is decentralizing its development: the first step was the introduction of Aragon One, the next step was announcing the onboarding of more teams to work on core infrastructure, in the near future. Well, the future is today! Aragon against censorship\u2014Goodbye Medium, hello Ghost Aragon is taking action against censorship by moving away from Medium On the journey that we are on, making Web3.0, the decentralized web, a reality, there will be obstacles we need to overcome. Hurdles set by those clinging on to their power by any means necessary, even going as far as putting on blanket bans on all crypto projects. This effectively is censoring content by those trying to make the world a more free and open place to live. July Deploying and distributing Aragon Core How to deploy and distribute a censorship-resistant upgradeable dApp From the inception of the first versions of Aragon Core we took building a truly decentralized app very seriously. We decided that just using Ethereum as the settlement layer was not enough, because if a significant part of the infrastructure depended on centralized servers, we would quickly become a central point of failure that could be taken down. Manifesto-based organizations How to fix soulless corporations from making everyone miserable In the ideal world, every organization has a manifesto with its mission and values. Those values could be ranked, just like in the Aragon Manifesto. If an organization fails to follow their manifesto, users can point out the value they broke. Aragon Monthly Issue 06 is out! The latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community. On Signaling and Social Pressure How the Ethereum community could begin making meaningful signaling-based decisions With the recent Mainnet release of our Survey app , I would like to propose the idea of Signaling DAOs as a way for stakeholder groups to self organize and produce clear signals. A Signaling DAO could be created by anyone, but in order for it to be impactful it should attempt to be representative of a relevant stakeholder group. Community Aggregation Theory \ud83d\udc08 Exploring how the valuation models fail to account for protocol commoditization This post explores how the valuation models used to evaluate decentralized service protocols leveraging \u201cwork\u201d tokens fail to account for protocol commoditization. June Aragon Core v0.5.1 Post Mortem\u200a\u2014\u200aPart 1 Summary of our first new development cycle Our initial goal is to establish three two-week sprints. These sprints define a six week cycle. We established this goal as a starting point for the new product development process. The goal emerged from a discussion at our last offsite meeting in Switzerland. 0.5.1 started immediately after the offsite, on 16 April 2018. Opening applications for the Building DAOs video series Join us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum With the recent launch of Aragon Core v0.5 we have seen a lot of renewed interest from people wanting to use Aragon to build their own decentralized organizations, or DAOs for short. To help kick off the process, we are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs. May Aragon launches Survey app on Mainnet First Aragon app launched on Ethereum Mainnet for community sentiment signaling Today we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders. Survey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting & Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet. Aragon Network\u200a\u2014\u200aOn a path towards a digital jurisdiction Launch of a new edition of the Aragon Network whitepaper and our research forum As we have continued on our journey thinking about the challenges of creating a jurisdiction designed to be inclusive of DAOs and other pseudoanynomous entities, the economics and mechanisms in the original whitepaper have continued to evolve. Thus far, this progression has mostly been loose thoughts scattered among various chats and in-person conversations. But as development of the underlying infrastructure to support the network is maturing, the need for formalizing how the Aragon Network will operate grows. Aragon Q1 Transparency Report A recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q1 2018 As per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. Releasing the Aragon Developer Portal A new command line tool for building Aragon apps, a straightforward tutorial, and reference documentation for all the building blocks Today, we introduce tools and documentation for: aragonOS, the smart contract framework that provides upgradeability and governance solutions out-of-the-box aragonUI, for a beautiful frontend experience aragon.js, in the middle connecting the two together Decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development III: Onboarding new teams Incentivizing new teams to work on common Aragon infrastructure We have already explained why we are decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development, how we are decentralizing the legal vehicle that represents the project and introduced Aragon One, the first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development. In this post, we will lay out the strategy for onboarding more teams to work on core Aragon infrastructure. Introducing Aragon One The first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development Since we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper, we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development. Today, we are announcing the next step. We are announcing Aragon One. First community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey! Tell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future Now that we have released Aragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven\u2019t used the app yet! Aragon Q1 Development Update Progress of development from the first quarter of 2018 Releasing Aragon Core v0.5, The Architect, was the biggest development milestone during the first quarter of the year. Aragon Nest: First awarded grants Five teams already funded and building is underway Now, it\u2019s time to introduce the first five projects that we\u2019ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems. The Aragon Manifesto A pledge to fight for freedom We believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another. Thus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies. Decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation Reducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project We have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project. April Aragon + Zug = \u2764 Aragon\u2019s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland We first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s cofounder and Aragon\u2019s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation\u2019s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aa vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein\u200a\u2014\u200awith Zug at its epicenter. But Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let\u2019s explore them. Aragon Team Update: March 2018 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting. March Aragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dThe Architect\u201d release The most powerful Aragon release to date We\u2019re extremely excited to be announcing the next major milestone of the Aragon project along with our brand new video! Team Interviews: Chris, Aragon\u2019s Product Manager Chris is joining the team to enhance the product development process even further Latest interviewee in our Team Interviews is Chris, Aragon\u2019s new Product Manager! We dive into his thoughts of how Ethereum and Aragon can help change the world for the better, what steps we can take to make creating Aragon an even better process and his philosophy on life. February Aragon Team Update: February 2018 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

Aragon @ ETHDenver Recap An incredible weekend of building and bonding with the Denver community This past weekend several members of the Aragon team, including Jorge, Luke, Oliver, and myself (John), attended ETHDenver in Colorado, USA. ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops. Team Interviews: Jouni, Aragon\u2019s Design Lead Jouni is an experienced designer who\u2019s looking to change the future of society and work This time on Team Interviews Jouni, Aragon\u2019s new Design Lead! We get into his previous work designing open source software, what kind of impact technology can have on our global living environment and how he sees Ethereum and the blockchain technology potentially shaping the future of society and work. Team Interviews: Bingen, Aragon\u2019s Solidity Engineer Bingen is a developer and an open source advocate joining Aragon to make the world a better place Today our Team Interview is with Bingen, Aragon\u2019s new Solidity Engineer\u200a\u2014\u200awe talked about his interest to make the world a better place through Aragon, and what are his thoughts on Ethereum. Aragon at ETHDenver Aragon is a proud sponsor, mentor, and bounty provider at the ETHDenver hackathon For all of February 16\u201318, 2018 you can find several of Aragon team members at the ETHDenver hackathon. We\u2019re proud to be sponsoring this exciting event and are very much looking forward to seeing what people come up with there. Decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development Splitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon For the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams. Announcing Aragon Labs Where research meets development The goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need. Until we are confident that our tools and products have become stable and mature. That their development has reached a point that signifies them ready to secure valuable ecosystems such as the Aragon Network itself. Aragon Team Update: January 2018 Written reviews of what the team members have been up to Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

Bringing DAOs back\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon Monthly Aragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs and the Aragon ecosystem Decentralized Autonomous Organizations aka DAOs have for too long been a taboo few dared to speak out loud. The catastrophic failure of The DAO ensured that the topic of decentralized organizations was pushed into oblivion. January Introducing aragonOS 3.0 alpha, the new operating system for protocols and DApps Smart contract codebase has been frozen, audit with WHG starts today and announcement for Aragon v0.5 release schedule The scope of Aragon\u2019s influence has been broadening ever since the team started growing from just myself and Luis to a dozen of brilliant freedom fighters... We\u2019ve gone from it being a nice way to manage a traditional business to a full-stack governance platform for sovereign individuals, organizations, and protocols in the blockchain. Launch of Aragon Nest Grants program is open for submissions At the end of 2017 we presented Aragon Nest to the community and encouraged people to start coming up with ideas for the launch... Now the time has come to launch the program.

To do this, on October 29, 2018, we will upgrade Aragon Core to version 0.6 on Rinkeby. This new version will include contracts that are not backwards-compatible with the existing v0.5 organizations.

In this first post, we will begin explaining the base of this new infrastructure, EVM Storage Proofs (aka 'The Ethereum Storage Time Machine'), a new technique we have developed that can be used to prove past storage values to other contracts. The future of organizations We believe that blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies are, at the core, a new way of organizing and unlocking human potential On this piece, we are going to touch briefly on the origin of companies and then we are going to focus on DAOs. We believe distributed organizations offer a potential solution to these issues as well as a good guiding compass for the future of companies. Trust Minimized Governance Tokens With the recent Mainnet release of Aragon, it\u2019s easier than ever to create an unstoppable organization and issue governance tokens. In this post I\u2019ll propose two potential mechanisms that would help minimize the trust required to use governance tokens by protecting the interests of minority and passive stakeholders without compromising self-sovereignty. September Using APM to replace NPM and other centralized package managers APM stands for Aragon Package Manager. The summary is that APM is a decentralized package manager. APM handles the upgreadability of smart contracts as well as arbitrary data blobs. A Blockchain Perspective on Three Product #BUIDL\u2019ing Motivations I've been thinking a lot about what motivates those of us BUIDLing blockchain products. Three types of motivation keep emerging in my consciousness and daily experience. Each type has its own attractions and difficulties. This post will explain my perspective on the three. August Enter the world of personal DAOs The next step after plain Ethereum accounts A personal DAO is your own Aragon DAO that acts as your agent in the decentralized world. A personal DAO borrows all the features you can expect from an Aragon DAO, but it isn't an organization comprised of multiple people.

After the presentations, we had the opportunity to meet with the other attendees and share our ideas. As part of the conversation, we were introduced to Jose Luis Mu\u00f1oz and found out he is the director for the Master's degree in blockchain technologies at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. We shared with him some of our day-to-day activities, and he thought it would be fun for us to showcase Aragon by proposing a lecture & workshop about it for their students. We were excited. What a thrilling opportunity! Proposal Agreements and the Aragon Court This post discusses how an organization will be able to create a Proposal Agreement, common use cases these agreements enable, and dependencies on the court As a set of smart contracts deployed to a blockchain, Aragon organizations are able to operate securely, transparently, and reliably. They can define permissions, manage funds, and require stakeholders to vote on actions. An organization can even perform arbitrary transactions and be used as a collectively-managed, permissioned Web3 wallet. May Team Interviews: Daniel, Web3 Engineer at Aragon One Daniel is our new Web3 Engineer He is a globetrotter at heart with an interest in culture and how people live their lives. Meditation, traveling and working with his hands are some of the things he enjoys besides engineering. Aragon One mid-2019 roadmap update Aragon One has already completed 30% of its roadmap for 2019 In January 2019, ANT holders welcomed Aragon One as a Flock team. They approved our roadmap for 2019, which was recently updated. I'll provide a brief status update, and also provide a breakdown initiative by initiative. Aragon Network Vote #2 Review On April 27, 2019 Aragon Network Vote #2 (ANV-2) concluded. This post is going to review what different commentators and stakeholders have said about the vote, and also share some of my own thoughts about what we can learn from the process, the results, and how to continue improving Aragon\u2019s governance processes going forward. Team Interviews: Adri, Brand Designer at Aragon One A film-maker, a world-class designer, the one responsible for the Aragon logo and branding. Adri is a multidisciplinary designer focused on branding, art direction as well as the audiovisual world and has joined Aragon One to lead our branding! Futarchy Courts Well constructed futarchy decision markets can be highly collusion resistant. This post goes into detail about what they are exactly and of their importance There are now over 500 Aragon organizations on mainnet and over 500 thousand dollars in ETH, ANT, DAI, and other assets held within organization vaults. The number of weekly active organizations has been increasing, going from 18 in January, to 45 in the last week in April. These numbers may seem modest, but it\u2019s important to remember how early we still are. The realization of an economy dominated by blockchain-native organizations will take time. There will need to be experimentation and iteration along the way. Not to mention improvements to user experience and scalability of blockchain infrastructure. Aragon Network and Token Primer The expectation is that as the Aragon Network DAO proves successful, more authority will be transferred away from the Aragon Association and into the hands of the Aragon Network. With this, ANT holders will gain more direct control of the Aragon project Governance, whether of a company, state, or blockchain, fundamentally boils down to who is a stakeholder and the rights to which those stakeholders are entitled. If you fail to clearly define stakeholders, or fail to establish and enforce their rights, governance has likely already failed. Establishing stakeholders and their rights is not sufficient to have effective governance, but it is a necessary prerequisite. Data-informed, vision-driven, user-obsessed Making the most of idealism, data, and user feedback Aragon has always been a very idealist project. It's not an IoT juicer or an app to send Yo to your bros. It's a vision of how the world should be, it's a fight for freedom. April Activism on Aragon Aragon has the potential to unleash a new wave of activism. Thanks to Aragon, an activist group could raise funds from anyone in the world. Donors could remain totally anonymous to avoid oppression. March Team Interviews: Paty, UX Designer at Aragon One Paty joins Aragon One as our new UX Designer. Her past work on open source software and strong take on human-centric design will be making a positive impact on the whole user experience of Aragon. Designing the Developer Experience for Decentralized Platforms Without developers, it is impossible to reach users. Let's explore what it takes for a decentralized project to bootstrap a developer ecosystem with some examples of what's effective and ineffective in developer relations. February Aragon Network Vote #1 Review This post will review what went well and what could be improved in Aragon Network Vote #1 (ANV-01). While we aren\u2019t going to be able to build the perfect governance system, toolchain, and communications plan overnight, we can use this feedback to inform a plan that improves on all these areas incrementally over time. Releasing Aragon Agent beta Aragon Agent is a fully-fledged Ethereum account owned by an Aragon organization. Agent also allows organizations to interact with other organizations, opening up an incredible amount of experimentation with inter-organization interactions. Running Aragon One as a remote team Aragon One has been a remote team since day one. Something interesting about remote teams is that they are very recent.

The Finance app is multi-token (plus ether). In order to remove the need of a trusted prices feed (oracle) for token exchange rate, every token is accounted on its own for budgeting and period financial statements. Definitions Accounting period Accounting periods are the equivalent of financial quarters in traditional organizations. Their length can be set depending on how the organization wants to use them. For every accounting period, a balance (called token statement) for every transacted token is kept, this balance will be negative if more was spent than deposited and positive if otherwise. Transactions A transaction records an event in which assets were deposited or spent through the Finance app. Spend transactions are called 'outgoing transactions' and deposits 'incoming transactions'. Every transaction occurs in an accounting period and counts towards its token statement. Transactions cannot be created directly, they are recorded as the result of an operation (either a payment being executed or a deposit made). Payments Payments are the construct used for spending using the Finance app. A payment can be created to happen only once or it can be a recurring payment that will be performed according to a certain time schedule. If executing a payment succeeds, it creates an outgoing transaction with a reference to the payment. Budgets Budgets give the ability to limit how much units of a token can be spent per Accounting period. Budgets are set in a token per token basis. By default no token has a budget, which means unlimited spending is allowed. Once a budget has been set for a token, the Finance app will only allow the budgeted amount of tokens to be spent for that period. Initialization Initializing a Finance app requires the following parameters: Vault: a reference to a Vault instance that the Finance app will use for depositing and spending tokens. In order for it to work correctly, the Finance app must have permissions to transfer Vault's tokens . Ether token : address of the EtherToken instance used as ether. Accounting period duration : the initial duration for accounting periods. Can later be changed for future periods. Lifecycle Deposits Two deposit mechanisms are supported: ERC20 token.approve(finance, amount) finance.deposit(token, amount, string reference) After doing an ERC20 approval with the Finance app as spender, calling deposit(...) will create an incoming transaction saving the reference string. ERC677 token.transferAndCall(finance, amount, string reference) Performing a ERC677 transferAndCall(...) to the Finance app will also trigger a deposit (intercepted with the tokenFallback ). The data passed as payload to transferAndCall is used directly as the reference for the deposit. Given that aragonOS' EtherToken implementation conforms to ERC677, depositing Ether to the Finance app can be done by wrapping the ether using etherToken.wrap() and then doing a transferAndCall(...) or using the shortcut wrapAndCall(...) which performs both actions. Please note that this section is subject to change as the ERC677 discussion evolves. Payments Depending on the parameters a payment is created with, it can be an instant one time payment, a recurrent payment for payroll or a scheduled payment. Creating payment finance.newPayment(...) A payment is created with the following parameters: Token : Address of token for payment. Receiver : Address that will receive payment. Amount : units of token that are payed every time the payment is due. Initial payment time : timestamp for when the first payment is done. Interval : number of seconds that need to pass between payment transactions. Maximum repeats : maximum instances a payment can be executed. In case a payment can already be executed on creation, it will be executed. If a payment is created that won't be repeated ever again, and already was executed, only an outgoing transaction is recorded to save storage. A payment can have a past initial payment time , which could cause many instances of the recurring payment to be executed at payment creation time. Executing payment finance.executePayment(uint256 _paymentId) finance.receiverExecutePayment(uint256 _paymentId) Payment execution will transfer the recipient of a payment the amount due depending on the current time. A single execution can result in multiple transactions if the payment hasn't been executed in time. To prevent it going out of gas when many transfers are due, a maximum amount of transfers are performed per execution (multiple executions could be needed in some instances). Payments can always be executed by its recipient, but there is also an additional role to the Finance app that allows another entity to execute the payment (recipient gets the funds in both instances). For payments whose token is the known EtherToken, instead of doing a token transfer, it will directly transfer ether to the recipient. A payment execution can fail in case the organization is out of budget for the payment token for that particular accounting period, or the organization doesn't have enough token balance. Disabling payments finance.setPaymentDisabled(uint256 _paymentId, bool _disabled) At any time, a payment can be disabled by an authorized entity. If a payment hasn't been fully executed until that time and it is disabled, the recipient won't be able to execute it until it is enabled again. Periods Setting duration finance.setPeriodDuration(uint64 _periodDuration) Sets the period duration for next periods. The current period duration cannot be modified. Setting budget finance.setBudget(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount) Updates the budget of a token for accounting periods. Newly set budget is automatically enforced for the current period. Removing budget finance.removeBudget(ERC20 _token) Removes budget for a token, allowing unlimited spending of that token in any period. Removing budget affects the current period. Transitioning periods finance.tryTransitionAccountingPeriod(uint ttl) All operations that can result in the creation of a transaction (creating a payment, executing a payment, performing a deposit) first check whether the accounting period needs to be transitioned (previous period has end time has passed) or it can be triggered manually by calling tryTransitionAccountingPeriod(...) . If many periods passed (last operation occurred two periods ago, but never transitioned), an empty period is created for every one of them. To prevent the case in which the Finance app cannot perform any operation because it needs to transition too many accounting periods, causing any operation to go out of gas, transitioning periods has a parameter for how many periods it will transition. Automatic transitions will only perform 10 transitions maximum, and if more were needed the operation will fail. In case this lock occurs and periods cannot be automatically transitioned, multiple period transitions operations can be triggered manually to remove the lockup. Limitations Payments are allowed to be created but can make it go out of budget. It can cause a race to execute payments right at the beginning of an Accounting period. Payment executions do not expire. There is an attack vector in which by not executing a payment in some time, a budget can be impacted when executed. In case this is happening, payment can be executed by another allowed entity or it could be disabled.","title":"[Finance](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/finance)"},{"location":"archive/dev/apps/finance/#finance","text":"Code in Github: aragon-apps/apps/finance The purpose of the Finance app is to be the central point for keeping track of income and expenses in an organization, as well as performing payments.

The sales that can be performed are simple capped sales with variable pricing over time. By tweaking some parameters, different sale dynamics can be achieved. More complex sale types can be implemented as 3 rd party applications. Dependencies and permissions Token Manager : On initialization it requires a reference to a Token Manager instance. One fundraising app instance is only able to 'sell' the underlying token managed by its Token Manager . The fundraising app must be granted permissions to mint tokens on the Token Manager . The Token Manager must have been initialized in Native mode so it can arbitrarily mint new tokens (See Token Manager spec ). Vault : A reference to a vault is also required on initialization. However, there is no direct interaction with the vault, it is just used as the address where sale proceeds are deposited (vanilla ERC20 transfers). Both parameters are not modifiable after initialization. Definitions Inverse pricing : Given that there is no native support for floating point numbers in Solidity, we need to introduce the concept of inverse pricing to allow for prices that are below 1. Token decimals must be taken into account when setting prices. When inverse pricing is false in a sale, price means how many input tokens must be payed for each token being bought. That means the amount of tokens bought is calculated as boughtTokens = payedTokens / price . When inverse pricing is true , price means how many bought tokens are acquired per input token. boughtTokens = payedTokens * price Price periods : A sale will go through one or multiple periods during its lifecycle. Periods determine what the price is at any given moment during the sale. A period starts at the same timestamp when the previous period ended (or in the case of the first one, when the sale starts). A period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time. Sales can have up to 50 periods. Caps : By default all sales are capped on two aspects, uncapping a sale can be done by setting it to a very large number. Setting one or both caps to UINT256_MAX should be interpreted by the client as being uncapped on that aspect. Max raised : Maximum amount of the token being raised that one sale accepts.

The controller of a MiniMeToken is an address that can mint and destroy tokens, it also gets a 'hook' call on every transfer and approval giving the controller the chance to note it and decide whether to let the transfer through. Its most important features are minting new tokens and locking token transferability over time (vesting). One Token Manager instance can manage one MiniMe token. Modes Token Manager can handle two modes or use-cases. The mode is set on initialization and cannot be changed. Native token mode : The managed token can be minted arbitrarily. Wrapped token mode : The managed token acts as a wrapper to another ERC20 token. The managed token can only be minted by staking (wrapping) units of the wrapped token. At any time a holder of the wrapper token can exchange it back for the original token (unless there is vesting). Initialization There are two different initializers depending on the mode. Native tokenManager.initializeNative(address token) Parameters: Token : The token being managed. The Token Manager should have already been set as the controller for the token. Wrapped tokenManager.initializeWrapped(address wrapperToken, address wrappedToken) Parameters: Wrapper token : Same as token above. Wrapped token : Address of the token that will be wrapped Mode specific functionality Native mode Mint tokens tokenManager.mint(address receiver, uint256 amount) Creates new tokens and assigns them to the receiver. Issue tokens tokenManager.issue(uint256 amount) Creates new tokens that are assigned to the Token Manager. Those can be later assigned. Wrapper mode Wrapper mode works under the assumption that the wrapped token is a trusted ERC20 implementation, meaning transfers are performed normally (no fees on token transfers like) and balances constant if no operations are made. Wrap tokens tokenManager.wrap(uint256 amount) Requires an existing ERC20 allowance to the Token Manager address for at least that amount of tokens. It will transfer the wrapped tokens to the Token Manager and mint an equal amount of wrapper tokens for the sender. Will fail if sender hasn't created the allowance or doesn't have enough wrapped token balance. Unwrap tokens tokenManager.unwrap(uint256 amount) It will burn the wrapper tokens and transfer the user the same amount in wrapped tokens. Will fail if sender doesn't own that many tokens. Generic functionality Assign tokens tokenManager.assign(address receiver, uint256 amount) Transfers tokens from Token Manager balance to receiver . Token Manager can own tokens as a result of an issue operation on native mode or just because the Token Manager received a normal token transfer. Assign vested tokens tokenManager.assignVested(address receiver, uint256 amount, { Vesting parameters }) Performs an assign but attaches rules on when the receiver can transfer her tokens. Next section goes in depth into how vesting works. Revoke vesting tokenManager.revokeVesting(address holder, uint256 vestingId) Revokes a vesting from a holder (if vesting is revokable). Vesting Assigning tokens with vesting performs a normal ERC20 token transfer operation but then the holder will only be able to perform transfers according to a vesting calendar. MiniMe tokens perform a check with their controller before doing a token transfer. This hook is used by the Token Manager to check whether a holder can transfer the desired tokens. By making the holders the direct owners of the tokens, they are able to use tokens for actions that check the token balance such as voting, while at the same time being able to lock transferability of them. Vested holders are also allowed to forward transactions through the TokenManager. Vesting parameters Start: timestamp in seconds that marks the beginning of the vesting schedule (can be a past or future date). Cliff: timestamp for the first moment in which any assigned tokens can be transferred. The amount of tokens that gets unlocked in the cliff is directly proportional to the overall vesting schedule. Vesting: timestamp for the moment all tokens assigned are transferable. Revokable: whether the Token Manager can revoke a token grant in the middle of the vesting. When that happens, tokens that are not vested yet are transferred back to the Token Manager. Calculating transferable tokens A token holder can have multiple vestings at the same time. For checking whether an amount of tokens can be transferred, the contract will check for all the vestings a holder has how many tokens can be transferred at that moment (note that some of the tokens may have been assigned without vesting). For every vesting, the amount: From start to cliff, 0 tokens are transferable. From cliff to vesting, the amount of transferable tokens is interpolated using this formula: transferable = tokens * (now - start) / (vesting - start) After vesting, all tokens are transferrable. Forwarder Token Manager allows holders of its underlying token to execute external actions by identifying themselves as token holders. This can be used for allowing token holders to perform a particular action in the DAO (e.g create a vote) without the ACL having to know anything about tokens. For this, Token Manager conforms to the aragonOS Forwarder interface and forwards calls to holders that own at least one token. Limitations In order to avoid an attack in which too many token vestings are added to a holder to cause an out of gas, the amount of token vestings a holder is limited to 50.","title":"[Token Manager](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/master/apps/token-manager)"},{"location":"archive/dev/apps/token-manager/#token-manager","text":"Code in Github: aragon-apps/apps/token-manager Token Manager is an abstraction layer over the concept of the MiniMeToken controller.

Aragon organizations are easily customizable, and they are also extensible by installing third party apps. Aragon organizations will be able to opt-in into the Aragon Network, which will provide services like a decentralized court arbitration system for them.

Firms or companies exist in order to create value by using resources to create products or provide services. However, intermediaries and third parties such as governments decrease the output of those organizations by imposing restrictions and creating complex regulatory frameworks. Aragon was born to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of companies and other organizational structures. Luis and Jorge were very inspired by Nobel prize Ronald Coase and his amazing paper The Nature of the Firm and Yochai Benkler's Linux and the Nature of the Firm . Both explore the concept of companies. At Aragon, we believe that the blockchain and the Internet are changing the incentives for companies to exist, and we are building tools for the next generation of companies that will take advantage of these changes. However, for decentralized organizations to be widespread, we need to make sure that they are easy to use, upgradeable/durable and able to resolve human disputes. We want to solve\u2014either us or partnering with others\u2014those points in order to make decentralized organizations widespread. And, thanks to the Aragon dapp and the Aragon Network, we can solve those points. Organizational Structure Aragon Community , defining the community members contributing to the dapp and Network and the Aragon Network Token holders. Aragon Association , from now on, the Association , a non-profit organization based in Switzerland, will serve as the umbrella organization responsible for allocating resources to other bodies for future cryptocurrency research and development going forward. The board of the Association consists of Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo. The Association will focus on overarching the mission and will enable operating organizations to accomplish the day-to- day work. The Association will also serve as a governance entity that will listen the Community until the Aragon Network is fully operational, from where the full governance of the Network will be transferred to the ANT holders. Aragon One AG , a Swiss for-profit corporation that serves the Association and employs the first team that will work on the Aragon platform and the Aragon Network. Development Milestones We will divide development milestones in the form of releases. Each release may have multiple deployment stages, from being in alpha stage\u2014running on the test network\u2014to begin in the production stage\u2014running on the main network\u2014going through multiple testing, security and QA stages. 0.1 \u2014 The Initial Release This the first release on macOS after months of work and weeks of privately-conducted community testing. Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to operate. It was not made public. Release Calendar Private Alpha : February 2017 Release link 0.2 \u2014 The Public Release This was the first public release. Working in both macOS, Linux and Windows. Introduced a new UI styling and Kovan testnet support. For more information, read the launch post . Release Calendar Alpha : February 2017 Release link 0.3 \u2014 The Governance Release This version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any ERC20 token as a governance token\u2014ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation\u2014stepping stone for more dynamic bylaws. It introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes. It featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc. Release Calendar Alpha : April 2017 Release link 0.4 \u2014 The Bridge Release This release will focus on adding: Economic abstraction Companies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding token Improved budgeting and accounting Organizations will be in itself the organization's bank account . Dividends Dividend sharing with shareholders, if desired. Fundraising tokens Company will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More flexible founding routes. Funds vault Final funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while maintaining its access to the funds. Release Calendar Alpha : July 2017 Release link : Deprecated due to refactor for Aragon 0.3 This will be a development version only focusing on smart contracts, iterating between different models for upgradeability, extensibility and security.\u2029 0.5 \u2014 The Architect Release This release will consist of a total refactor, and will focus on adding: Organization-wide identity Entities in organizations will be able to register their own usernames in the organization, and also provide offchain metadata for displaying purposes in the UI. Full upgradeability Organizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if big chunks of functionality are swapped. Totally new permission system Extensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL (Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains. Switch to an exokernel architecture By making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to the installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity in apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier. Front-end apps API This will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality. We will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI toolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns. Core apps API The API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more low-level capabilities. Decentralized package management By creating the Aragon Package Manager , which is a decentralized organization built on Aragon itself, we enable the frontend and smart contracts to be seamlessly upgraded by using any governance mechanism compatible with aragonOS. Human readable transactions Thanks to our work on Radspec , the Aragon interface can show users a human readable description of the actions the users take on the app. Support for templates Templates allow users to bootstrap organizations with the proper permissions to replicate multiple existing models such a startup, a democracy, an open source community... with just a click. Survey app on mainnet The Survey app is an app built on Aragon that enables token holders to signal their support to different proposal. The first one is live on the mainnet now at https://survey.aragon.org . Blockchain projects that have already manifested interest Release Calendar Alpha : April 2018 Bug bounty (mainnet) : From May 2017 to July 2018 Beta (mainnet) : August 2018 Release link This will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet. After months of public bug bounties in the mainnet, we will start allowing the first organizations to be created using Aragon in the mainnet. 0.6 \u2014 The Sweet Release This release will focus on adding: Permissions app This app will allow stakeholders to read and alter permissions on the organization, by using the modular permission system established by aragonOS. Identity component The identity component will replace all Ethereum addresses with easy to understand identity icons and names for user friendliness, and also serve to autocomplete entities while interacting with the app. Stability fixes Fix bugs and possible issues, both for users and also developers using our developer tools to create Aragon apps. Release Calendar Beta (mainnet) : August 2018 0.7 \u2014 The Network Release This release will focus on adding: Basic network-wide governance Which power the network will have over organizations, governance votings to decide on service providers, payouts functionality. App center The App center will allow third party apps to be installed in Aragon in order to enable different organizations to address different needs. Any aragonOS-compatible app will be able to be installed, and recommendations will be given to users. ANT token minting The network will be responsible for the minting policy of ANT, it will be decided through the governance of the network. Some of its responsibilities will be to decide the minting rate, the price and how companies pay for the subscription to the network. Integrate upgradeability Provide upgradeability as a network service for all Aragon Network organizations. Release Calendar Alpha : November 2018 Bug bounty (mainnet) : December 2018 Production deploy (mainnet) : January 2019 0.8 \u2014 The Court Release This release will focus on adding: Aragon Jurisdiction Provide a decentralized court, Aragon Jurisdiction, as network service or work with a decentralized court project to make it work with the network. Orgs in the AN respond to ANJ Organizations in the Aragon Network start being under the Aragon Jurisdiction. Constitution proposal First proposal for the basic laws that all organizations will be act under. Release Calendar Alpha : Q1 2019 Bug bounty (mainnet) : Q2 2019 Production deploy (mainnet) : Q3 2019\u2029 0.9 \u2014 The Unknown Release This is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing. Some ideas of what we might work on here: Privacy-focused companies zkSnarks could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are very interesting concepts we are researching about. Different governance mechanisms We are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms such as Futarchy . 1.0 \u2014 The Release We expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release. To achieve that mission, we will have to place an important focus on design and user experience.","title":"Development Plan"},{"location":"archive/documentation/Development_Plan/#development-plan","text":"**This development plan has been deprecated in favor of the project roadmap . version 1.2","title":"Development Plan"},{"location":"archive/documentation/Development_Plan/#introduction","text":"Aragon is everything you need to run organizations (companies, NGOs, associations, open source projects...) on the Ethereum blockchain.

Updated Jan. 14 th , 2018. An exokernel -inspired architecture for modular, upgradeable, and secure DAOs Introduction This exokernel-inspired architecture enables modular, upgradeable, and secure Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It implements a UNIX-inspired permissioning system with smart contracts to allow for safe and efficient control over software resources. Smart contracts, an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem, can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions and enforce prior commitments, such as transfering large amounts of funds. However, such significant responsibilities make smart contracts a prime target for attacks. Testing and auditing them are not absolute remedies because, inevitably, humans make mistakes. So, how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And how do we provide upgrading capabilities to these DAOs, to ensure the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem? We present our secure decentralized operating system: aragonOS . This document provides a technical overview about the architecture. For a less technically-oriented introduction to aragonOS, you can check the announcement blog post . 1. Kernel and the Access Control List The Access Control List (ACL) is the filter which determines whether an entity has a certain role in the context of an app. It either permits or prohibits performing actions, such as an update, in a given context, as well as determining the entities with power over that permission. The ACL permissioning system is inspired by UNIX. ACLs control the permissions afforded to a user in the system and can ease the transfer of said permissions. Similar to the sudo command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity. A reference implementation of the Kernel and its ACL can be found here: Kernel.sol . Apps and Actions **App**s are smart contracts that rely on the Kernel\u2014the core of the operating system\u2014for maintaining their ACL and upgrading their code. Apps can interact with users and other smart contracts by implementing **Action**s, where each action is a publicly-accessible function that may or may not be protected by the ACL. Any actions that are protected are only allowed to be executed if the caller is permitted by the ACL. Because apps are upgradeable, we expect them to exist for a long period of time and be safely responsible for owning assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names). App instances are identified by their deployed Ethereum addresses. More than one instance of a particular app can be installed in a DAO at a time (e.g. multiple Token Manager instances can be installed to control multiple tokens). Roles Another feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of **Role**s, where each role grants access to one or more of the app's actions as part of the app's ACL. Any entity wishing to perform an action protected by the ACL must have the necessary permissions by having a role that is capable of executing that action. Roles are always unique to each app. Having a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform that same role in other apps. An entity can have many roles in one app. Example: contract TokenApp is App { bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234; function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 } } TokenApp is an app that defines one action, mint() , whose execution is controlled by MINT_ROLE . Entity An Entity is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example, a voting app that only executes an action if token holders vote favorably), or a simple private key controlled account. The system can delegate permissions to groups of entities by implementing a Group app. As in other apps, it can rely on the ACL for protecting important functions, such as adding or removing members of the group. When group members want to execute a specific action, the Group app acts as a proxy contract that performs the action on behalf of the group. Permissions A Permission is defined as the ability to perform actions (grouped by roles) in a certain app instance (identified by its address). We refer to a Permission Instance as an entity holding a certain permission. When a permission is created, a Permission Manager is set for that specific permission. The permission manager is able to grant or revoke permission instances for that permission. Create Permission kernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address manager) createPermission() will fail if that permission has pre-existing permission instances. This action is identical to grantPermission() except it allows the creation of a new permission if it doesn\u2019t exist yet. A role in the ACL protects access to createPermission() as this important function could be used in malicious ways. When the Kernel is initialized, it also creates the permission that grants the initializing address the ability to create new permissions. Note that creating permissions is made mandatory by the ACL: all actions requiring yet-to-be-created permissions are disallowed by default. Any permission checks on non-existent permissions are failed automatically. Grant Permission kernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role) Grants role in app for an entity . Only callable by the manager of a certain permission. This entity would then be allowed to call all actions that their role can perform on that particular app until the permission manager revokes their role with revokePermission() . The grantPermission() action doesn\u2019t require protection with the ACL because an entity can only make changes to a permission if it is the permission's manager . Revoke Permission kernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role) Revokes role in app for an entity . Only callable by the manager of a certain permission. The revokePermission() action doesn\u2019t need to be protected by the ACL either, as an entity can only make changes if it is the manager for a given permission. Set Permission Manager kernel.setPermissionManager(address newManager, address app, bytes32 role) Changes the permission manager to newManager . Only callable by the manager of a certain permission. The new permission manager replaces the old permission manager, resulting in the old manager losing any management power over that permission. createPermission() executes a special case of this action to set the initial manager for the newly created permission. From that point forward, the manager can only be changed with setPermissionManager() . Events createPermission() , grantPermission() , and revokePermission() all fire the same SetPermission event that Aragon clients are expected to cache and process into a locally stored version of the ACL: SetPermission(address indexed from, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed to, bool allowed) setPermissionManager() fires the following event: ChangePermissionManager(address indexed app, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed manager) Example As an example, the following steps show a complete flow for user \"Root\" to create a new DAO with the basic permissions set so that a Voting app can manage the funds stored in a Vault app : Deploy the Kernel Executing kernel.initialize(rootAddress) creates the \"permissions creator\" permission under the hood: createPermission(rootAddress, kernelAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, rootAddress) Deploy the Voting app Grant the Voting app the ability to call createPermission() : grantPermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress) (must be executed by rootAddress ) Deploy the Vault app, which has a action called transferTokens() Create a new vote via the Voting app to create the TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE permission createPermission(votingAppAddress, vaultAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, votingAppAddress) If the vote passes, the Voting app then has access to all actions in the Vault protected by TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE , which in this case is just transferTokens() Fund transfers from the Vault can now be controlled via votes from the Voting app. Each time a user wishes to transfer funds, they can create a new vote via the Voting app to propose an execution of the Vault's transferTokens() action. If, and only if, the vote passes, will the transferTokens() action be executed. Note that the Voting app is also able to revoke or regrant the TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE permission as it is that permission's manager on vaultAppAddress . Adding Permissions Apps have the choice of which actions to protect behind the ACL, as some actions may make sense to be completely public. Protecting an action behind the ACL is done in the smart contract by simply adding the authentication modifier auth() (passing the role required as a parameter) to the action. On executing the action, the auth() modifier checks with the Kernel whether the entity performing the call holds the required role or not. Escalating Permissions Consider kernel K , an entity E 0 , and an app A . E 0 wants to perform action A act on app A . The client knows, from information provided as part of the app's metadata , that in order to perform A act , an entity is required to have A role . Since E 0 doesn't hold A role , the client should know that E 0 cannot directly call A act , but that a list of entities [ E 1 , E 2 , ...] do have that role on app A . The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to E 1 , E 2 , etc, such that E 0 is able to perform A act through another, higher-privileged, entity. Calculating a forwarding path requires knowing what forwarders entity E 0 can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform A act . For example, E 1 may be a Voting app V , so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call A act . Since V has role A role , it has permission to execute A act , and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation. Permission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the Token Manager app , then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote. Note that a permission escalation can occur instantly or be delayed and require further action from other entities, like in the case of the Voting app. Forwarders In order to make permission escalation easier, we define a common interface for **Forwarder**s: contract Forwarder { bool isForwarder = true; function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool); function forward(bytes evmCallScript); } If a user wants to enact an action it cannot perform directly, it can check if there are forwarders. This checks for privileged entities that are accessible to any of the user's addresses for forwarding the action to. EVM Call Script The evmCallScript parameter in the Forwarder's interface allows for executing multiple calls with just one transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case of votings, as it allows approving multiple actions with just one vote. An evmCallScript is the concatenation of multiple evmCallAction s. A evmCallAction payload is: [ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes) ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ] When executed, actions in the evmCallScript are executed one at a time using the CALL opcode. If any one of the actions fails (i.e. CALL returns 0), the entire execution is reverted. A reference implementation for EVM Call Script can be found here: EVMCallScript.sol . 2. Upgradeability Upgradeability of the system is achieved by using the DelegateProxy pattern. Kernel and apps ( KernelProxy and AppProxy ) both use DelegateProxy with some added functionality. Given that new versions of apps or the kernel run in the exact same context as previous versions, the old storage layout must be taken into account. Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading. 2.1. Kernel upgradeability For the Kernel to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a KernelProxy contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address. Note that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly. 2.2. App-space upgradeability As apps can be used as entities (e.g. a voting app), it is important that each app is able to keep its address fixed to maintain its identity even if an upgrade changes the underlying logic. Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address. One way of achieving this is through the concept of an AppProxy contract (inspired by augur-core\u2019s Delegators ). Deploying an app via an AppProxy contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by delegatecall ing into this address. It should be noted that multiple AppProxy contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple Fundraising AppProxy instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps. Set App Code kernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode) This action updates the implementation code registered for a given appId , such that all future calls to the app will use the new app code. If multiple app instances are installed for the given appId , they are all updated at the same time with this action. Note that all calls to an app will fail if an appId has not been set for its appCode . 3. Initialization The contracts that get deployed for each Kernel and app don't contain any business logic due to them relying on a proxy-like architecture for upgradeability. The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called. However, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code. We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the AppProxy contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, AppProxy allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps. It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events. 4. App discoverability and package versioning Technically, an app A is nothing more than a simple AppProxy contract holding a reference to a kernel K and an appId . If A doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in K , A is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps). All relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are AppProxy s, and checking if those AppProxy s have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those AppProxy s' appId s are considered installed in the DAO. Application identifiers ( appId s) should be the namehash ed ENS name for the app's deployed contract: appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d) An app's appId can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts). Aragon owns and provides aragonpm.eth as a domain for developers to register their packages under. However, the system is designed to be domain agnostic: for example, district0x could decide to have all their packages under packages.district.eth . App Repos After discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its appId and use ENS to resolve its Repo contract: repo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId) Repo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for version upgrades. Each Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner. A Repo keeps versioned state over: Smart contract app code ( contractAddress ): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version. Package content ( contentURI ): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it. By versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps: Patch : Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users. Minor : Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update. Major : Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade. A correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules: Only one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0. Example: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version). Changes to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule). By having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its appId and appCode . Additional Packaging Requirements The package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard manifest.json . We also introduce a specific eth.json file with the following keys, to help connect an app's frontend to its smart contracts: abi : Standard Ethereum Contract ABI bytecode : Initialization code for deploying the app code to the network. functions : An array of all the relevant function signatures for the contract, with its natspec description, argument names, and whether the function is protected by the ACL or not (and which role is required, if protected). These can be automatically generated on package publish. permissions : An array of permissions the app needs to have over other entities in order to work. This will probably be dependent on initialization parameters. For example: a Finance app will need permissions over the Vault it is initialized with. verification : An object providing the needed information to independently verify the source code of the deployed code. Required values include: deployTxId , sourceCode , and the compiler settings, solc version, and optimization settings. An initial implementation of the contracts supporting package management can be found in the apm-contracts repo .","title":"aragonOS v2.0.1"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#aragonos","text":"Reflects aragonOS 2.0.1 implementation.

E 0 wants to perform action A act on app A . The client knows, from information provided as part of the app's metadata , that in order to perform A act , an entity is required to have A role . Since E 0 doesn't hold A role , the client should know that E 0 cannot directly call A act , but that a list of entities [ E 1 , E 2 , ...] do have that role on app A . The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to E 1 , E 2 , etc, such that E 0 is able to perform A act through another, higher-privileged, entity. Calculating a forwarding path requires knowing what forwarders entity E 0 can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform A act . For example, E 1 may be a Voting app V , so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call A act . Since V has role A role , it has permission to execute A act , and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation. Permission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the Token Manager app , then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote.

Kernel and apps ( KernelProxy and AppProxy ) both use DelegateProxy with some added functionality. Given that new versions of apps or the kernel run in the exact same context as previous versions, the old storage layout must be taken into account. Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading.","title":"2. Upgradeability"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#21-kernel-upgradeability","text":"For the Kernel to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a KernelProxy contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address. Note that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly.","title":"2.1.

Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address. One way of achieving this is through the concept of an AppProxy contract (inspired by augur-core\u2019s Delegators ). Deploying an app via an AppProxy contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by delegatecall ing into this address. It should be noted that multiple AppProxy contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple Fundraising AppProxy instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.","title":"2.2.

The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called. However, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code. We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the AppProxy contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, AppProxy allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps. It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events.","title":"3. Initialization"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#4-app-discoverability-and-package-versioning","text":"Technically, an app A is nothing more than a simple AppProxy contract holding a reference to a kernel K and an appId . If A doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in K , A is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps). All relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are AppProxy s, and checking if those AppProxy s have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those AppProxy s' appId s are considered installed in the DAO. Application identifiers ( appId s) should be the namehash ed ENS name for the app's deployed contract: appId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d) An app's appId can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts). Aragon owns and provides aragonpm.eth as a domain for developers to register their packages under.

App discoverability and package versioning"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#app-repos","text":"After discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its appId and use ENS to resolve its Repo contract: repo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId) Repo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for version upgrades. Each Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner. A Repo keeps versioned state over: Smart contract app code ( contractAddress ): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version. Package content ( contentURI ): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it. By versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps: Patch : Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users. Minor : Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update. Major : Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade. A correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules: Only one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0. Example: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version). Changes to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule). By having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its appId and appCode .","title":"App Repos"},{"location":"archive/documentation/aragonOS_201/#additional-packaging-requirements","text":"The package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard manifest.json .

Planning for the development of Whitepaper v2 and prototypes of the Aragon Network. I will be personally working on the Aragon Network as soon as v0.5 is launched. Did an internal roadmap for the initial part of 2018. In general, we were very happy to see how many things in our Dev Plan can probably be executed sooner than we expected thanks to core infrastructure work, such as aOS, paying off. Thanks to the team for coming but specially to our amazing advisors, Jake and Brayton, and our partners, Joel and Chris. Having people that don't work with us on a daily basis living with us for a week was invaluable. Standards ERC897: Delegate Proxy w/ Manu (Zeppelin) ethereum/EIPs!897 ERC900: Simple staking interface w/ Dean (Harbour) ethereum/EIPs!900 We will continue working on standardization of most of our work to allow better interop with other projects and support from common infrastructure such as wallets or block explorers. We started a standards working group with Colony, DAOStack, Harbour and Zeppelin. Staking app The Staking app that Oliver started, have received some more work and is now being worked on as part of aragon-apps aragon/aragon-apps!101 It is a very important component that will be used in Aragon's modular generic TCR implementation and the Aragon Network. ETHDenver It was a really productive week and we were super pleased with what people built. Personal thoughts: https://twitter.com/izqui9/status/966338031719415809 Leading up to ETHDenver we did a ton of work on documentation to get it to a point where people could use aragonOS and our tooling to build apps on top of Aragon. People were able to do so, but documentation will require some more work during the following months. Doing a postmortem soon to analyze what went well and poorly and how to improve for future hackathons. We will be doing a lot more as they are really valuable. Audits and bug bounty WHG audit is progressing. Part of the team met the auditors in BCN for two very productive days. Some architectural improvements have been proposed and are in the way of being implemented. In general we are getting green light and it is not going to be a stopper for launch. We are making arrangements for another audit that will begin during the first half of March. This will audit deployed code to the mainnet and will be the green light towards launch. A live bug bounty will begin during the first half of March. Expect more details soon.

Helped onboard Chris Remus , Aragon's product manager Chris joined us in Madrid the first week of March, for a productive week of organizing the product pipeline and assess our current processes. Chris already helped a lot coordinating and organizing the last mile of the v0.5 launch, and he will be the owner of the next development cycles. Tech New Vault with support for arbitrary token standards was developed and integrated as part of the release. With this new Vault, Aragon organizations are able to own ERC777 and ERC721 NFTs in an easy way. We deployed the first instance of apm-serve a bridge to APM in the web2 at aragonpm.com Worked on the server infrastructure to support Aragon v0.5. Even though it is fully decentralized and trustless thanks to IPFS and the APM, having some support nodes is helpful. Anyway all state is computed trustlessly on every client, no node-mongo stack. We have also hired a devops to help us take our server infrastructure to the next level. Jordi Baylina and the team at DappNode deployed the first Aragon Package Manager Registry in the Ethereum mainnet, making it the first mainnet live Aragon DAO.

Hey there fellow creators! This post aims to be a resource for anyone who wants to set up any kind of organization using Aragon\u2019s technology, which released its beta just a few days ago . It\u2019s supposed to function as a workshop in which creators find the initial guidance necessary to start experimenting with the possibilities of DAOs, the new kind of digital organizations! The style of the guidelines that follow is very basic: someone with pretty much no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Ethereum should get a solid understanding of the mechanics on how to create a DAO on top of Aragon following 3 simple steps. Aragon\u2019s beta version is now live on the Rinkeby Testnet, and here we\u2019ll talk about that version (Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect). For future deploys, we\u2019ll make additional posts. The Basics What is a DAO? DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is an organization built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, a set of smart contracts that allow for organizations to operate following new governance models that will make even Silicon Valley startups seem traditional . I wrote more deeply about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations' nature here . Benefits of a DAO Can\u2019t be censored Programmable governance modules for different organization models Tokens easily and transparently distributed Operates under a digital jurisdiction in our current digital era No central power can be corrupted Easier to attract talent around the globe to contribute to the organization\u2019s mission Various entities: people, other orgs, software\u2026 Transparent transactions ... many more! What does Aragon do? Aragon does many useful things! First and foremost, Aragon provides simple software for the setup of any organization . Within a few clicks and very little cost, you can start running a digital organization. Sounds good huh? It also provides a digital jurisdiction for governance and dispute resolution: the Aragon Network . To understand Aragon\u2019s mission in the crypto & DAO space, you can check a little post I made about it, or watch an awesome video released by the team! The Aragon Mission Empowering unstoppable organizations through freedom of collaboration Getting Started So, you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re creating an organization in 21 st century fashion? Awesome! Let\u2019s dive into the 3 simple steps you have to follow to get started using the software that will facilitate the organization\u2019s operations from now on. \ud83c\udf7c Step 1: basic Ethereum tools We\u2019ll take for granted you know a little bit about what a blockchain is and what Ethereum does (if not, there\u2019s plenty of information online for you to dive into). Yet, some tools and terms might seem confusing, so we\u2019ll outline some very easy to follow definitions about key tools that you must know to set up a DAO. Ether : Ethereum\u2019s currency/token. The fees to set up the organization, vote, etc. will be paid in ether. (Rinkeby) Testnet : Ethereum network built for testing purposes where the ether transacted is virtual; doesn\u2019t hold real value . Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect is deployed on this testnet. To get faucet funds for the Rinkeby Testnet, follow this link . MetaMask is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum Dapps (like Aragon) directly from Chrome, Firefox or Brave. More info and installation help can be found here . Etherscan allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum. Aragon 0.5 will point us to Etherscan when we want to check transaction history of the apps, and some other activities we\u2019ll see now. \ud83d\udc23 Step 2: create the DAO Ready to create your DAO? Visit aragon.one and click on the blue button on the top right corner that says \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d. That will open up a very intuitive initial menu where you must provide the basic infrastructure of your organization. First, you will have to choose between using Democracy or Multisig for your Token project. Multisig is still very early in the making and has pretty much no utility at the moment, so we\u2019ll move forward with Democracy. Second, you must claim a domain name in _____. aragonid.eth fashion. We chose workshop.aragonid.eth, as shown below, and clicked Next. Third, we must choose 3 metrics for our Democracy project. They are Support (%), Minimum Quorum (%) and Vote Duration (time). Support is the % of votes an outcome must get to be a winning outcome (in this case, we chose a simple 50% majority). Min.Quorum is the minimum % of token holders that must participate for the vote to be accepted, for which we chose 23% as an example (Min.Quorum can be a bit confusing specially for small organizations: we\u2019ll take a deeper look later when working with the Voting app). Vote Duration represents the time a vote is open; we chose 72 hours. Next, we have to choose the name and symbol for our DAO\u2019s token. We wrote AWK as the ticker. Finally, we must sign two transactions (Token Creation and Organization Creation) with our MetaMask wallet. Testnet price to set up the DAO was ~$50 at the time of the experiment, which depends mostly on the Ethereum Network fees. Remember, it\u2019s virtual ether for now! Clicking twice on Submit (green button) should finish the process, and you should get a message like the one below. Congratulations! Your DAO is ready. Let\u2019s click on Get Started! When we click on the blue Get Started button, we are entering our Aragon DAO for the first time. Exciting! The homepage should present us with four functions regarding the 3 apps available. We\u2019ll now take a deeper look into each one of those. P.S. This is the creation process for a DAO on Aragon. To enter the DAO afterwards, we must simply open it after clicking \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d on aragon.one by entering its name and clicking on \u201cOpen organization\u201d, as shown below. \ud83d\udcce Step 3: use the apps you need Now that we\u2019ve set up our DAO, we can use the three apps available (for now). They are Token Manager, Voting and Finance, and we\u2019ll also look at the DAO\u2019s settings. They all can be accessed by clicking on the menu at the left of the screen. \ud83d\udcca Token Manager The Token Manager lets you distribute your organization\u2019s tokens amongst stakeholders. At first, the MetaMask wallet address you used for the creation of the DAO will own 100% of the tokens. To assign tokens to other DAO members, click on the blue button at the top right corner that says \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d. There, you must provide a valid Ethereum Address for the Recipient of the tokens, and the number of tokens you want to mint. We have chosen to mint 0.1 tokens for the address below. This action will inherently open a vote about the decision to mint the tokens, with your vote in favor. Since you\u2019ll be the only token holder at the moment, the vote will automatically close with a Yes. You\u2019ll have to sign the transaction using MetaMask. After assigning tokens to a couple of addresses, your Token Manager should look somewhat like this (check total token distribution at the right of the screen): For a more technical description of the Token Manager, see here . \u270b Voting The Voting app is an entity that will execute a set of actions on other entities if token holders of the DAO decide to do so. To open up a new vote, click on the top right corner \u201cNew Vote\u201d button. Then, we must simply state what the vote is for, and click on Begin Vote. You\u2019ll have to confirm the transaction through MetaMask (it\u2019ll open itself automatically). To see the details of a certain vote, you can click on View Vote at the right of the screen. It should open up a dashboard like the one below. Remember that you have to be a token holder to be able to participate in a vote in a certain DAO. There, we have the Status of the vote, the Quorum (this is set when setting up the DAO), the Question, its creator, and the current results. In the Workshop\u2019s case, I am holder of 76% of the DAO\u2019s tokens, so as soon as I voted on something (you automatically vote Yes when creating a vote) the vote was closed (as seen in the screenshot). This was confusing at first, but makes sense mathematically; Quorum and Support were met as soon as I voted! I would recommend to keep this in mind when allocating tokens for testing purposes with your fellow creators or partners, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to really try out Voting. For a more technical description of the Voting app, see here . \ud83d\udcb0 Finance The purpose of the Finance app is keeping track of income and expenses in your organization, as well as performing payments. At first, your finances will look somewhat empty, as the DAO holds no funds of her own yet. You can use your MetaMask wallet to send some funds to the DAO, or use some other Rinkeby options available for fund transfer. The address to use will be specified later, in the Settings section. In our case, we sent 0.9 to the DAO, which show up in the panel after the transaction takes place in the Ethereum network (you must wait a bit). Now that the DAO owns funds, you can perform payments by clicking on the \u201cNew Transfer\u201d button on the top right corner. Then, you must choose the Recipient\u2019s address, the amount of tokens and the token (ETH, ANT\u2026) in which you want to send the payment, and add a Reference (short phrase) to identify it. It will be sent by clicking on Submit Transfer. For a more technical description of the Finance app, see here . \ud83d\udd29 Settings You can find the Organization\u2019s and the Apps\u2019 addresses in the Settings tab. You should not send funds to the DAO by transacting with the Organization\u2019s address! I made this mistake and wasted a bit of my time, I guess. Good warning Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect operates on Rinkeby\u2019s Testnet, so you can request test tokens by clicking that option on your DAO\u2019s settings, as seen above, and that will send some test tokens for the DAO to play with. You can also send tokens directly to the Finance app of the DAO, which has its own address. Either way, the funds will appear on the Finance tab shortly after. The Token Manager and the Voting app of your DAO also have their own addresses, and their updates can be checked on Etherscan. Below are the recorded transactions of our Workshop\u2019s Voting app. To check out more info about the current and future Aragon apps, visit the wiki . \ud83d\udc99 Bonus Step: enjoy the journey! These are the basic things you need to know to set up and operate a DAO with Aragon\u2019s current software. Now it\u2019s time to have fun! The team is always active in the community chat , so for any further doubts it\u2019s a good idea to reach @light or @tatu there; they\u2019ll quickly help you solve your problems. Some questions were recurring in the chat and social media, so I thought I\u2019d contribute with an explanatory post summarizing the 3 initial steps for anyone to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Thanks a lot for reading!

Create an ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet If you already have an ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet, you can skip ahead to Step 2. We recommend either MyCrypto or MetaMask for ease of use. Be sure to copy and store your \u201cseed phrase\u201d or \u201cprivate key\u201d in a safe place to ensure that you do not lose access to your funds. Step 2. Sign up for a GitHub account If you already have a GitHub account, you can skip ahead to Step 3. Visit https://github.com and click the \u201cSign up\u201d button to create a new account. Visit the \u201cSecurity\u201d page in your account \u201cSettings\u201d and turn on \u201cTwo Factor Authentication\u201d. This will help prevent your account from getting compromised by hackers. Step 3. Log in to Status Open Bounty with your GitHub account If you are already logged in to Status Open Bounty, you can skip ahead to Step 4. Visit https://openbounty.status.im and click the \u201cLog In\u201d button. Click the \u201cAuthorize status-open-bounty\u201d button. This will connect your GitHub account to Status Open Bounty, enabling easy bounty payouts. Step 4. Add your Ethereum address to your Status Open Bounty profile If you have already added your Ethereum address to your Status Open Bounty profile, you can skip ahead to Step 5. Click \u201cMy payment details\u201d in the top menu and copy+paste the address of your ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet into the text field. You can also click the box to \u201cDisguise myself from the top hunters and activity lists\u201d if you do not want your GitHub profile to show up on the public Status Open Bounty website. Click the \u201cUpdate\u201d button to save your settings. Step 5. Filter search results to show only Aragon bounties This isn\u2019t necessary but will make it easier to look through all of the open Aragon bounties. On the \u201cBounties\u201d page, click the \u201cOwner\u201d search filter and select the \u201cAragon\u201d box. Step 6. Click on a bounty you are interested in and review the details of the bounty This bounty is in the \u201caragon-monthly\u201d repo of the Aragon GitHub organization. It has a bounty of 5 ANT for submitting a news link to the Aragon Monthly newspaper. Click on the \u201cCode\u201d tab to find the \u201cREADME.md\u201d file that tells you about the repository that hosts the bounty you are interested in. Also see if there is a \u201cCONTRIBUTING.md\u201d document with specific instructions about how to contribute to the repo. In this example, the instructions for contributing are located in the README.md file of the aragon-monthly repo. In other repos, the instructions may be located in a CONTRIBUTING.md file. Step 7. Submit a pull request to the repo hosting the bounty with a correct solution to the issue You can either use the GitHub Web UI, a Desktop Git UI, or a Command Line Interface text editor to submit your Pull Request. If you have never used Git or GitHub before, there is a helpful \u201cGit for beginners\u201d guide here and a more in-depth guide here . If your Pull Request is accepted and merged, then the Status Open Bounty app will pay out the advertised bounty to the address that you added to your profile in Step 4. Congratulations! You\u2019ve just earned your first Aragon bounty.","title":"How to claim an Aragon bounty using Status Open Bounty"},{"location":"archive/tutorials/Status_Open_Bounty_Guide/#how-to-claim-an-aragon-bounty-using-status-open-bounty","text":"","title":"How to claim an Aragon bounty using Status Open Bounty"},{"location":"archive/tutorials/Status_Open_Bounty_Guide/#step-1-create-an-erc-20-compatible-ethereum-wallet","text":"If you already have an ERC-20 compatible Ethereum wallet, you can skip ahead to Step 2.

The more people you can financially incentivize, the better. We need to create a better culture around financial incentives. The initial prop in Nest report was 16% of grant amount to Nest manager and 4% to Nest DAO. Do we want to rethink that? - Ex: for MESG the reward would be around $4K for the whole process at the end of all milestones. Almost all regular Aragon ecosystem contributors are A) employed full time, and B) have a maxed out workload. If we restrict compensation to community contributors who are not on payrole very few people will be eligible. People who are qualified to contribute will not want to because they're already busy. It's going to be very hard to decentralize the network if there's a no incentive for full time contributors to get involved in more DAOs and WGs. Ex: it's Saturday morning and I (burrrata) am writing this agenda and working on NestDAO related things such as creating new Keybase groups and Notion pages. This is obviously voluntary and on top of all the other work I'm doing. I'm doing it because someone needs to do it otherwise it will not get done. We're literally trying to change the way the world operates by making DAOs a thing in the world. This is non trivial and takes a lot of work. We should inventivize people who want to do work to do as much work as possible as often as possible and as well as possible. Communication Channels? We are currently using Keybase groups. In chats many Nest members agreed that we should improve our communications infrastructure, but were wary of adding on yet another platform/service to keep track of and manage. @burrrata - Created a new nest_dao keybase group with multiple channels so that nest_dao members can more effectively allocate their attention to matters of interest. (cost: free) - Also created a NestDAO Notion page for NestDAO members to discuss NestDAO related stuff. (cost: $10 per month, but everyone already has it) @stellarmagnet - Recommends Loomio . Created a doc explaining the benefits of Loomio . - Cost: according to the Loomio pricing page it's $1 per user per month @louisgrx - Wants to make sure that we make public how to participate in the DAO and get onboarded. We should explore how to be more transparent. NestDAO Membership offboarding Notes Nest investment meeting protocol NestDAO member assigns a deal to themselves to open GitHub Issues to lead the deal application lead writes investment memo application lead shares investment memo with NestWG 1 week before upcoming Nest investment meeting NestWG discusses investment memo during Nest investment meeting if NestDAO members have no further questions or blockers on the proposal, put it to a vote during the meeting once a proposal is put to a vote the lead for the proposal needs to notify the team in their GitHub Issue votes are open for 14 days, but can be executed early if the required support is reached Task Coordination We're happy using Notion as a task manager. CRM We're going to explore using Notion because then we can keep everything all in one place The lead for a deal is responsible for keeping the Notion task and GitHub Issue updated In the future if we want to change that we can Incentives Is the time sink enough of an incentive to discourage people from leading all deals? - we think so Skin in the game? - NestDAO members need to ensure that the project is successful, otherwise they will not get more funding => thus NestDAO members are incentivized to curate membership and if members are not adding value they will be off-boarded All NestDAO members and managers are eligible to be compensated. This rewards members based on the work they do. This will allow the NestDAO to act as a decentralized autonomous organization. This will also incentivize people within the Aragon community (or outside the community) to spend extra time on top of their full time job to contribute to the NestDAO. Transparency We need to make sure that information is publicly available on how to participate in the DAO. This includes, but is not limited to onboarding, participation, and offboarding. We should explore more ways to make the NestDAO more transparent, engaging, and accessible. - will create a task (and assign Louis to it) to explore how this might work Communication Channels GitHub, Keybase, and Notion are what we are using currently. They work. Open to exploring Loomio, but hesitant to take on a new platform. - Yalda will create Loomio threads for refining current RFP drafts (\"who voted for what\" app and the \"memberships/subscriptions\" app) - Will create a Notion task and announcement on NestDAO Keybase Other If you lead a deal, you must abstain from voting on your own deal. - someone will need to check this on a vote by vote basis until we automate the process Need an RFP to create a way to see who voted on what in DAOs. When we launch the Mainnet DAO we will add the Projects app to create bounties for NestDAO operations and tasks.

This will comprise a consolidated 2 year vision (short-term to find product market fit) and longer-term vision (20 years+). Deadline for community submissions: Wednesday 30 th October Deadline for communicating Flock team leads: Wednesday 30 th October Process: a) Community replies to this forum post: https://forum.aragon.org/t/community-reunion-your-vision-for-aragon/1387/8 b) Louis will consolidate answers to examine common trends for the 20 year / 2 year vision. c) Flock teams to inform Louis who will be the lead coordinator for their team by Wed 30 th October. Phase 1 - Problem identification / Data Collection Objective: Phase 1 of this exercise involves a community driven exploration into Aragon's respective product lines to understand problems/blockers that have occurred historically, or are likely to occur, and prevent a rapid discovery of product market fit. This in-depth research will be community curated with representatives from each Flock teams as well as Nest teases acting acting as lead facilitators. Part of this phase will involve a feasibility study to understand how well they align to Aragon's community curated 2 year vision. We intend to not only surface the most important problems but also collect as many data points as possible within the time period available to back them up. ***Deadline for problem/supporting data submissions:** Friday 8 th November * Process: - Aragon Analysis and Strategy leads will drive the process forward. This includes creating the framework around the project, posting updates to the working group, aggregating community feedback, posting milestone based updates to the forum, and producing phase 0 and phase 1 of the report. - Aragon team leads will provide insight into how their team sees the Aragon vision, the pain points they experience (and see Aragon experiencing), and how we can best move forward with strategies to address those pain points. - Aragon community members will have the opportunity to weigh in on milestone based (phase 0, 1, and 2) forum posts explaining what we did and what we will do next. **Phase 2 - Solution identification / simulation planning / ** Objective: The problems identified in Phase 1 will be presented to the community prior to phase 2 starting. The objective of phase 2 is to obtain community curated potential solutions to these problems. It's likely that the recommendations and solutions will be numerous, and we expect there to be varying points of views across community members. Some of these will be subjective and others may be quantifiable. For those which are quantifiable, we invite community members to submit a simulation analysis to support potential solutions that they provide. As with phase 1, phase 2 will also involve comparing potential solutions to each other in reference to Aragon's 2 year vision, cash reserves, and simulated growth projections.

Then see what works and what doesn't. Phase 1: Then create a more formal program that is clearly defined and has rewards (User Feedback DAO). Phase 2: Then explore more complex mechanisms with Aragon Fundraising and/or Open Enterprise.

We also occasionally have supported events outside of these scopes to reach people in communities that could greatly benefit from the use of Aragon and its products. Sponsorship policy The Aragon Association will sponsor a maximum of 4 large-scale events per calendar year. A maximum sponsorship we will consider is up to CHF 50,000 . A large-scale event has to be relevant to what Aragon is building and provide an ample forum for presenting Aragon at the event. The Association has budgeted an additional CHF 100,000 per year towards sponsoring Aragon community meetups around the world. Aragon wants to encourage community members to organize events like meetups, hackathons, and other community events. We are happy to support and help you organize such an Aragon-related community event and will consider backing such events on a case-by-case basis. Events have to be supportive of the goals and values of the Aragon Manifesto . Events must have a Code of Conduct that doesn't tolerate harassment of participants in any form and shares sentiment and values with the Aragon Code of Conduct . Organizing policy Each team or individual participating in an event sponsored by the Aragon Association is responsible for covering all costs associated with attending the event. The final decision for all event sponsorships is made by the Events Manager ( @john-light ), who is hired by the Aragon Association to be the main owner and point of contact for all events. The Events Manager is responsible for proactively seeking high-quality events for Aragon to sponsor and participate in, as well as ensuring that our participation in events is as successful as possible. The Events Manager sets criteria that determines what \u201csuccess\u201d means for a given event and leads the creation of a plan to ensure success.

See the PDF file above for the untouched original report. Introduction This audit report was undertaken by @adamdossa for the purpose of providing feedback to Aragon. It has been written without any express or implied warranty. The review focussed on the Solidity contract code in these repos, and covered: possible attack vectors mismatches between logic and documentation possible code improvements confusing functionality or naming The review was performed using the code tagged with audit1 at the following commits. aragonOS : https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/audit1/contracts aragon-apps : https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/audit1/apps We used RocketChat to coordinate the review and help resolve questions during the review process. Overview Overall the code structure was readable, well-documented and structured coherently and consistently. Functions largely conform to the best practices at: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html making the structure and code easy to parse and understand. The codebase also included comprehensive testing suites, using the Truffle testing framework. The Aragon team also employs a coverage framework and linter process to ensure their code remains consistent and testing comprehensive. The team was responsive, measured and prompt in their responses and feedback during the process. General Comments There were a few functions that were missing explicit function visibility modifiers. This has been reviewed and corrected (including linter updates) via: aragon/aragon-apps!33 In addition to the below there are a few miscellaneous fixes and improvements that have been made, including additional testing coverage and minor fixes. These include: aragon/aragon-apps@4925309 aragon/aragon-apps@c239847 as well as many other incremental improvements which have been made during and after this audit process. aragonOS/contracts/kernel These contracts form the core Kernel implementation. The Kernel manages app and Kernel permissions and provides a layer of indirection to access apps (allowing apps, including the Kernel, to be upgraded as necessary). Issues There were a few areas of the documentation which were either out-dated, or possibly confusing. These included: description of Grant Permission which has now been amended to make the conditions of this operation clearer. making the separation between instantiation and initialisation clearer. correcting some minor mistakes in the example code for Create Permission These issues have now been resolved in a number of pull requests: aragon/aragon-wiki@32b6f1c aragon/aragon-wiki@b2cde71 aragon/aragon-wiki@c3a734c Possible Improvements Some possible future improvements were identified, specifically: events being triggered when permissions were used. managing the instantiation / initialisation of contracts (see below section for more details). continuing to work on documentation to make the permission framework as clear as possible. aragonOS/contracts/apps and aragonOS/contracts/common These contracts contains the logic required for both proxy contracts (which allow the underlying \"business logic\" contracts to be upgraded) and forwarding (which allows entities to forward transaction scripts to other entities for execution). Issues Pre-Byzantium logic could now be removed from DelegateProxy as returndatasize opcodes are now available. This has now been resolved via: aragon/aragonOS!145 The use of delegatecall to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the DelegateProxy whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable App contract. The below represent areas that could be clarified in the documentation, rather than bugs in the code. Since the App code is expected to have state / storage, this imposes a limitation that any new upgraded version of the App has a superset of the previous contract which it is replacing. Since state is maintained in the DelegateProxy contract, not the underlying App contract, this may cause some practical issues with third-party apps such as exchanges or etherscan.io (for example I don't believe the \"Read Contract\" functionality on etherscan.io would work as the ABI wouldn't have the relevant functions on the DelegateProxy contract, and the state on the App contract wouldn't reflect updates). There were a few areas of documentation which use inconsistent terminology (e.g. scaling vs. forwarding) which have been resolved via: aragon/aragon-wiki@c3a734c One of the identified issues related to the instantiation and initialisation of AppProxy contracts not being atomic. In the expected use-cases, where AppProxy contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is some potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run AppProxy contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional initializePayload to be passed to the AppProxy constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation. aragon/aragonOS!148 Possible Improvements Given the use of delegatecall , the documentation could clarify the intention as to whether App contracts are designed to be used as factory contracts, or redeployed for each Aragon organisation. It may be sensible to make the 10000 gas in AppProxy a variable that can be modified to account for any future changes to opcode gas costs for delegatecall . aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts This contract allows votes to take place on arbitrary actions, using the MiniMeToken to determine voting power of token holders. Issues The VoterState of Absent doesn't seem to be used anywhere - not sure if this is in for some future purpose perhaps, if not it could be removed. The Voting app automatically executed a vote payload once the outcome of the vote was beyond doubt. Whilst this is useful functionality, it made it hard for a voter to estimate gas requirements and the effect of their vote transaction deterministically (as the outcome depended on whether or not the vote tipped the balance). A boolean parameter has now been introduced to allow a voter to specify whether or not they want their vote to automatically execute the vote payload (if appropriate) via: aragon/aragon-apps@ae8a92e Possible improvements Currently the duration of a vote is fixed on initialisation of the Voting contract - it may be worth considering making this a per-Vote variable instead to allow for both long and short-dated votes. Since the _minAcceptQuorumPct can be modified during the lifetime of the contract, it may be that users also want to change voteTime as well. The event CastVote should include the number of votes being cast to allow easier off-chain tracking of vote status. This has now been resolved via: aragon/aragon-apps@8ea8cda When modifying the _minAcceptQuorumPct through changeMinAcceptQuorumPct it may be worth emitting an event for this change. This has now been resolved via: aragon/aragon-apps@03f2644 When creating a new vote through the forward method, it may be worth putting a non-blank _metadata in to make it clearer to track where the vote has come from. This could incorporate the forwarding entities address. aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts This contract manages token actions through the MiniMeToken contract (either wrapping another token, or natively). Issues canForward allows holders of tokens which have not yet vested to forward request - this may be intentional, but worth clarifying in the documentation. It is technically possible for a single TokenManager to be set as the controller for multiple MiniMeToken contracts. It may be worth asserting in the TokenController functions ( onApprove , onTransfer , proxyPayment ) that msg.sender matches the expected token value, to avoid any misconfiguration. Possible Improvements The vesting model follows broadly the Zeppelin approach. In my experience clients have often wanted a simpler model with a single cliff date, upon which all tokens vest. This is not possible to achieve with the implemented approach as the tokens must vest linearly between the start and vesting dates (with nothing vesting before the cliff date). It may be worth mentioning in the documentation that it is important to set the controller in the MiniMeToken to be the TokenManager (i.e. that it isn't sufficient to initialise the TokenManager with the MiniMeToken but that the link needs to go both ways). aragon-apps/apps/group/contracts This contract acts as a simple way to permission a group of entities as a single entity. Issues In the documentation, there is a minor grammatical mistake - the phrase \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that the only other context the group possesses.\" should perhaps be \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that it is the only context the group possesses.\". aragon-apps/apps/fundraising/contracts This contract is responsible for raising funds (in any ERC20 token, which could include wrapped Ether) in return for a new ERC20 token. Issues In line 297, it should be (period.finalPrice != initialPrice) rather than (period.finalPrice != 0) . From the documentation, it says: \"A period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time.\" This has now been resolved via: aragon/aragon-apps@4925309 In function _buy the calculation of returnAmount is subject to rounding errors I believe. i.e. in the isInversePrice case, if dividing by pricePrecision leads to rounding, then re-multiplying by pricePrecision may not yield the expected value. This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems. The initialize function could check that the TokenManager is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable _tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0 . Having getCurrentPrice behave differently on a call / sendTransaction may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a constant function instead. I agree that functionally this works as transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded is always called before any other state modifying functions execute. calculatePrice has an implicit dependency on transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between sale.periodStartTime and sale[currentPeriod].periodEnds . This is redundant in the current code (since transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded is always called before calculatePrice but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts). This has now been resolved via: aragon/aragon-apps@c239847 Possible Improvements Adding a token purchase function which allows a beneficiary address (rather than msg.sender ) to receive tokens may be useful. Having the ability to associate a script to be called on a sale closing may be useful. This script could for example ensure that no more tokens could be minted (effectively capping the issued tokens supply) by revoking MINT_ROLE permissions from the TokenManager , or allow the FundRaising contract to transfer CREATE_SALES_ROLE permission to a different entity (i.e. a VotingApp associated with the token being issued). Maybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to raisedToken and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this raisedToken and issuedToken or similar). i.e. uint256 returnTokens = ... could become uint256 returnRaisedTokens = ... , _payedTokens could become _paidRaisedTokens , _value in tokenFallback could become _paidRaisedToken , sale.minBuy would become sale.minRaised and so on. I'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each Sale could have a different raisedToken ), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing. I can see that it may be required to have a follow-on sale, but wonder whether having each sale being represented by a new FundRaisingProxy may be simpler / clearer. aragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts This contract is responsible for tracking transactions (payments or deposits) across an organisations token balances, and managing scheduled payments. Given the importance of this contract and the value there would be in exploiting it, it may be worth having this specific contract be audited separately by multiple individuals and / or placing a bounty within a live deployment to encourage investigation. Issues Any reason why the minimum payment duration is 2, rather than 1: require(_periodDuration > 1); I can see that you use settings.periodDuration - 1 as the duration length, but not clear why you don't just use settings.periodDuration (with the requirement that settings.periodDuration > 0 ); In both tokenFallback , and deposit the _token.transferFrom and token.transfer methods could potentially re-enter the Finance app. I can't immediately see how this can cause an issue, but worth being aware of. It may be worth mentioning in the documentation that payments can be \"back-dated\", in which case the receiver will be eligible to execute all \"back-dated\" payments. This has now been resolved via: aragon/aragon-wiki@b2cde71 If the budget for a token is reduced during a period (via setBudget ) it is possible that _getRemainingBudget may throw if the amount already spent ( periods[currentPeriodId()].tokenStatement[_token].expenses ) is larger than the new budget (in which case settings.budgets[_token].sub(spent) will throw). It may be better to return 0 rather than throwing in this case. _makePaymentTransaction could record the payment reference in the corresponding transaction reference. Possible Improvements There are no restrictions on what ERC20 tokens can be used for deposits. This would allow an attacker to create an ERC20 token which always returns true on _token.transferFrom without actually depositing any tokens. Whilst this isn't really an issue it would be possible to bloat the transactions array. Not sure there is really an easy solution to this, although having an optional \"whitelist\" of allowed token addresses that can be deposited is an option. aragon-apps/apps/vault/contracts This contract is used to store an organisations tokens (and wrapped Ether). Any actual balances will be held in the corresponding AppProxy contract. This is a nice and simple contract, with no obvious issues. Possible Improvements Potentially integrating this contract with the Finance contracts budget functionality. In other words setting a budget in the Finance app could require a corresponding allowance in the Vault app for the given token.","title":"Audit (Preliminary) by Adam Dossa"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit01_report_dossa/#aragon-05-audit-by-adam-dossa","text":"This was the initial review of the aragonOS system that powers the v0.5 release of Aragon.

Original report in Github Date: Jan 22-23 2018 Overview Reviewed aragonOS @ 8073ed1438c5fa65c45bd0c14cc5433e273656f9 Reviewed aragon-apps @ e8e931e4ff389bfc6d8682f99c067f808f321366 ; linked as submodule in the repo Will wait until aragon-apps is upgraded to aragonOS 3.0.0 before running Oyente and unit tests as some contracts in aragonOS have moved in 3.0.0 (causing compile issues) Slight, non-logical modifications were made to some contracts for running Solgraph (see cd431a899af22b6f67787a8fc6cf7e1c60f8a6a7 ); these changes should not be adopted Slight, non-logical modifications were made to some contracts for running Oyente (see 475b72f81c1a6fd136391ff1bf3a93228fb57d91 ); these changes should not be adopted General comments No linting errors All unit tests passing ( aragonOS only; see note above) Uses industry-standard library contracts for common operations, including OpenZeppelin and MiniMe As a scale, I'm using: High-severity: anything that can result in loss of funds for users, or otherwise achieve highly damaging effects on user DAOs Mid-severity: exploitable issues, but either preventable in some way, technically difficult (or impossible) to solve for every one in the ecosytem, or very low probability of actually being exploited Low-severity: nice-to-haves, very low incentive attacks Out of scope I have, for the most part, ignored: Any contracts in lib folders Any contracts in factory folders (they're mostly for demonstration right now) An exhaustive look through the unit tests to see if they miss any obvious functionality (100% code and branch coverage is a good start but is usually not the whole story) aragonOS Issues Mid-severity AppProxy should fail on construction if _kernel is not a contract aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol : Kernel-less apps are impossible: the fallback function will always fail on kernel.getAppCode(appId) if kernel == 0 or if the kernel address is not a contract. aragonOS/contracts/apps/AragonApp.sol : canPerform() would not require the address(kernel) == 0 check anymore as the proxy would fail to be created before that point aragonOS/contracts/apm/ApmRegistry.sol : initialize() 's require(kernel != address(0)); check can be removed AppProxy may use garbage data as its target : aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol : If the AppProxy 's kernel is set to a non-kernel contract address, kernel.getAppCode(appId) will return garbage data due to how the fallback works . This means that in delegatedFwd(target, msg.data) , target could potentially be delegating to a malicious contract. As far as I know, exploiting this would be extremely difficult, but it should be clear in the surrounding documentation that the kernel MUST be carefully set. KernelProxy should fail on construction if _kernelImpl is not a contract aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : delegatedFwd(kernelImpl, msg.data) will always fail if kernelImpl == 0 or is not a contract. In such a case, it would also be impossible to run upgradeKernel() . KernelProxy s' initialization can be front-runned: aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : initialize() is public and accessible to anyone after the proxy is deployed. This should at least be highlighted in documentation for Kernel.initialize() and the KernelProxy so as to make sure users always create and initialize these proxies in one atomic transaction, but a better solution would be to introduce the same initializePayload that is in AppProxy . Kernel.revokePermission() can be front-runned: aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : There are many possible outcomes when revokePermission() races with an entity wishing to perform an action associated with the revoked role. As in all front-running cases, the entity learning of the revocation has the upper hand as he can send his transactions with much higher gas prices. I don't see any good way around this, as this is a pretty general problem plaguing all systems implementing revocable controls. It may be a good idea to note this in the comments and associated documentation. The best way around the problem is just to never give permissions to an entity you don't entirely trust, but this is obviously not very practical (yet). Low-severity APMRegistry.NewRepo event should index its id and repo fields aragonOS/contracts/apm/ApmRegistry.sol Repo should use pragma solidity 0.4.18; aragonOS/contracts/apm/Repo.sol AppProxy should fail if _appId is bytes32(0) aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol : A valid appId will never be bytes32(0) AragonApp could be split into AragonApp and InitializableAragonApp aragonOS/contracts/apps/AragonApp.sol : Apps that don't need to initialize don't need to inherit from Initializable . However, doing this would make it difficult for an app to include the ability to initialize later on, although it's debatable whether or not that functionality would be desirable (what does it mean for already created apps if the app changes to require initialization?). EtherToken 's wrap() , wrapAndCall() , and withdraw() should be made external aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol : I don't see many use cases for subclassing this contract (since it's specific to ETH) so any functions not used internally could be made external EtherToken 's wrap() could also take a receiver address aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol : Seems odd that wrap() always deposits to the msg.sender while wrapAndCall() allows you to choose who to send it to EtherToken.withdraw() includes an unnecessary check: aragonOS/contracts/common/EtherToken.sol : Strictly speaking, require(balances[msg.sender] >= _amount) is unnecessary since balances[msg.sender].sub(_amount) will also do this check DelegateProxy.delegatedFwd() could take a gas parameter: aragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol : It may be useful to provide a control over how much gas is provided to the delegatecall in case of gas price changes or particular uses (e.g. super large returns or gas-restricted calls). I don't think this is a pressing concern, however, and it may be suggesting additional flexibility for the sake of flexibility. IForwarder.isForwarder() should be made external aragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol : There's no reason to ever use isForwarder() internally... right? Initializable library instances can be initialized: aragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol : Not a big deal because library contracts' states are meaningless, but it'd still be nice if Initializable provided a way for these library contracts to be initialized on creation (e.g. by providing a constructor that sets initializationBlock ) ENSSubdomainRegistrar.createNameAndPoint() should accept an owner parameter aragonOS/contracts/ens/ENSSubdomainRegistrar.sol : Mirror createName() 's interface and increase flexibility Nomenclature: aragonOS/contracts/common/EVMCallScript.sol : EVMCallScriptRunner.LogScriptCall event should be named ScriptCall to adhere to the same pattern as all other events (no Log prefix) aragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol : Function names and arguments have a naming mismatch; names are called in terms of permission s whereas arguments are always called in terms of role s ChangePermissionManager event could have its manager parameter renamed as newManager for clarity Comments: aragonOS/contracts/apps/AppProxy.sol and aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol : Fallback function: a note indicating that no return statement is needed for delegatedFwd() to return a bytes32 value would be nice (it is puzzling at first glance why the comments say they return data but the function signatures and bodies don't contain return s; it's additionally puzzling because Solidity disallows fallbacks from returning). Also, I believe it's more than just a bytes32 being returned now (post Byzantium); it should be the entire return? aragonOS/contracts/common/DelegateProxy.sol : Would be nice to have an @returns comment aragonOS/contracts/common/IForwarder.sol : Would be nice to have some comments documenting the interface aragonOS/contracts/common/Initializable.sol : initialized() : Function to be called by subclassed contract to signal it has been initialized. may better reflect the intended usage of initialized() aragonOS/contracts/kernel/IKernel.sol : Might be nice to move some of the comments detailing functions from aragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol to the interface contract aragonOS/contracts/kernel/Kernel.sol : It may be useful to have a detailed example for each complex mapping, e.g: mapping (address => mapping (address => mapping (bytes32 => bool))) permissions could have (entity => (app => (role => hasPermission))) Remove all instances of parent and replace with manager setAppCode() : suggest changing @dev comment to @dev Changes implementation address for all installed apps with \\ _appId`. This must be called for `_appId` before any apps of `_appId` work properly. solc build warning: aragonOS/contracts/apm/Repo.sol:78:5: Warning: Function state mutability can be restricted to pure function isValidBump ( uint16 [ 3 ] _oldVersion, uint16 [ 3 ] _newVersion ) public view returns ( bool ) { (All other build warnings are either from 3 rd party or test contracts, and of low severity) Unused library code: aragonOS/contracts/lib/zeppelin/math/Math.sol Check and update library contracts for latest versions (e.g. Zeppelin, MiniMe) if any bug fixes have been introduced In general, it may be a good idea to introduce ETH / ERC20 escape hatches for non-Vault contracts (e.g. see Escapable , or an even simpler contract that just exposes a function allowing owner to withdraw any ETH or ERC20 token owned by the contract ) Alternatively, contracts could revert in the fallback function and ERC223/677 callbacks, but ERC20 tokens could still be locked up aragon-apps Issues Low-Severity General Given that most storage arrays in the apps are never iterated, they could be implemented with mapping (bytes32 => ...) s instead, where the key is keccak256('<type>', currentNumOfType) . The main advantage of this is being able to avoid any index manipulation targeted for humans (i.e. forcing some arrays to start at 1 because 0 doesn't make intuitive sense). Also, a pseudorandom bytes32 value arguably makes more sense as an identifier than an incrementing uint . Clients could listen to the logs (or rebuild the hashes, if currentNumOfType is known) to build their UIs. Finance aragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts/Finance.sol : Should add clarifications as to whether a token must be added to the budget before being allowed to create payments l204 has a comment stating this to be the case, but the associated require() does not actually complete this check Comments may be beneficial for mappings (e.g. token => budget for budgets ) tokenStatement should be renamed tokenStatements Consider increasing the minimum periodDuration to be greater than one second Extremely small periodDurations can cause the app to be onerous to maintain Deposit logic may benefit from being abstracted into internal _deposit() and _depositFrom() methods Improve DRYness when the combo of _recordIncomingTransaction() and token.transfer() or token.transferFrom() are used newPayment() acts differently for one-time, immediate payments than repeating payments when the payment fails One time payments cause a revert if they cannot be immediately executed while repeating payments will log a PaymentFailure event. It may be beneficial for both cases to match so as to avoid unexpected behaviour for users. One way of accomplishing this would be to cache a one-time payment if it cannot be immediately executed. setBudget() should check that _amount is greater than or equal to the current period's expenses Changing a budget to be smaller than the current period's expenses will likely be confusing for clients and should be avoided Remove payment date check from executePayment() and receiverExecutePayment() require(nextPaymentTime(_paymentId) <= getTimestamp()) is already checked in _executePayment() view getters can be made external nextPaymentTime() (l402): payment should be a storage variable nextPaymentTime() 's casting from uint256 to uint64 (l410) should have an associated require(nextPayment <= MAX_UINT64) getTimestamp() should return uint64 to conform with other dates _canMakePayment() should be view TokenManager aragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts/TokenManager.sol : transferable and logHolders could be grouped together to save some storage assignVested() could be renamed to assignVesting() to clarify that it creates a vesting for an entity rather than assigning already vested tokens to an entity allHolders() and spendableBalanceOf() could be made external isBalanceIncreaseAllowed() should use .add() : return token.balanceOf(_receiver).add(_inc) <= maxAccountTokens transferableBalance() 's _time parameter should be of uint64 for consistency with other dates calculateNonVestedTokens() should sanitize its time inputs: require(start <= cliff && cliff <= vesting) calculateNonVestedTokens() 's vestedTokens calculation could be simplified to uint256 vestedToken = tokens.mul((time - start) / (vesting - start)) (assuming sanity checks above were performed) _assign() should also call _logHolderIfNeeded(_receiver) Voting aragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts/Voting.sol : Add veto role: give an entity the ability to decide a vote unianimously Example use case: give certain entities (e.g. President) extra power to decide votes more quickly (allows them to have more power without being assigned other permissions). Example use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching minAcceptQuorumPct , a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower minAcceptQuorumPct . At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire. Allow minAcceptQuorumPct to be provided when creating a new vote The main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the minAcceptQuorumPct for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back). Implementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage. forward() should always use the default percentage. In struct Vote , startDate and executed could be grouped together to save some storage struct Vote 's totalVoters could be renamed to totalPossible to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes canExecute() should use .add() (l153): uint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay) view getters can be made external _isVoteOpen() should cast up rather than down: return now < uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime)) && !vote.executed; _isValuePct() could be renamed to _isAtLeastPct() for clarity _isValuePct() should use .mul() (l268): uint256 m = _total.mul(_pct) Tools Solgraph Only EtherToken.sol was flagged for having an untrusted transfer() to another contract (see Oyente for a note on this). Noted that solgraph is non-exhaustive and only assumes contracts to be untrusted if they send funds to an external contract. However, it can be useful for quickly telling which contracts are likely to be more complicated, as well as helping visualize the interdependencies between functions in a contract. Test details Created function graphs via: # Globstar and multiple variable substitutions may have to be turned on in your shell # aragonOS for contract in contracts/**/*.sol ; do echo 'Graphing' ${ contract } mkdir -p solgraph/ ${${ contract #contracts/ } %/* } solgraph ${ contract } | dot -Tpng > solgraph/ ${${ contract #contracts/ } % \\. sol } .png done # aragon-apps mkdir -p solgraph/aragon-apps for contract in aragon-apps/apps/**/contracts/*.sol ; do echo 'Graphing' ${ contract } solgraph ${ contract } | dot -Tpng > solgraph/aragon-apps/ ${${ contract #*/contracts/ } % \\. sol } .png done Note : currently requires my fork of solgraph (install via npm install -g git+https://github.com/sohkai/solgraph.git ) Oyente In non-lib files, Oyente only reported a single potential error: EtherToken.sol (transaction order dependency) On analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem. The only time re-ordering would have an effect would be if someone tried to take out more than their total balance in multiple (different value) transactions. The total amount withdrawn would be indeterminate but no contract invariants would be invalidated. Re-entrancy shouldn't be a problem either, as all state changes happen before the call to transfer() . Oyente also reported a potential re-entrancy error in MiniMeToken.sol On analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem Note that Oyente wasn't able to parse interface files, but even if it could, it wouldn't find any issues in them Test details Ran tests using supplied docker image: # Globstar may have to be turned on in docker's bash docker pull luongnguyen/oyente docker run -i -d -t luongnguyen/oyente # Find name of container via docker ps docker cp ./contracts <name>:/contracts docker attach <name> # Upgrade solc to 0.4.19 sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ethereum/ethereum sudo apt-get update sudo install solc = 1 :0.4.19-0ubuntu1~zesty # aragonOS ( docker ) > for contract in /aragonOS/**/*.sol ; do echo 'Testing' ${ contract } dirname = ${ contract %/* } dirname = /aragonOS/oyente/ ${ dirname #/aragonOS/ } mkdir -p ${ dirname } filename = ${ contract % \\. sol } filename = /aragonOS/oyente/ ${ filename #/aragonOS/ } python oyente.py -s ${ contract } 2 > ${ filename } done # aragon-apps will be tested after updating to use aragonOS 3.0.0 docker cp <name>:/aragonOS/oyente oyente/results/ Note : tests were run after being compiled with solc=0.4.19 (contracts were modified to all allow ^0.4.18 compiler versions). Some Oyente modules also had to be modified to include allow-path=/aragonOS whenever solc was run. Maybe this could be done better in the future with standard json support. Future Considerations E2E integration tests for a full-scale DAO deployment with installed apps would be nice, especially covering common use cases (e.g. setting up the Voting app to control a Token Manager or Vault)","title":"Audit (Internal) by Brett Sun"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_internal_sun/#bretts-audit","text":"This was an internal audit by Brett Sun/@sohkai , Aragon\u2019s EVM Engineer of the aragonOS and aragon-apps that power the v0.5 release of Aragon.

Example use case: in a stalemate due to not reaching minAcceptQuorumPct , a DAO may want to restart a vote with a lower minAcceptQuorumPct . At that point, the previous vote could be vetoed to be unsuccessful to allow a new vote to start right away, rather than having to wait for it to expire. Allow minAcceptQuorumPct to be provided when creating a new vote The main utility I could gather from allowing this parameter to be modified was that a DAO may choose different levels of importance for different votes (of the same type, i.e. time and required support), where size of quorum is a proxy for importance. However, given the current implementation, it would require multiple steps to change the minAcceptQuorumPct for a single vote (you'd have to change it, create a vote, and then change it back). Implementing this could be done via an overload, storing the quorum percentage given on initialization as the default percentage. forward() should always use the default percentage. In struct Vote , startDate and executed could be grouped together to save some storage struct Vote 's totalVoters could be renamed to totalPossible to avoid confusion over whether it holds the total number of individual voters or total possible votes canExecute() should use .add() (l153): uint256 totalVotes = vote.yea.add(vote.nay) view getters can be made external _isVoteOpen() should cast up rather than down: return now < uint256(vote.startDate).add(uint256(voteTime)) && !vote.executed; _isValuePct() could be renamed to _isAtLeastPct() for clarity _isValuePct() should use .mul() (l268): uint256 m = _total.mul(_pct)","title":"Low-Severity"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_internal_sun/#tools","text":"","title":"Tools"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_internal_sun/#solgraph","text":"Only EtherToken.sol was flagged for having an untrusted transfer() to another contract (see Oyente for a note on this).

We were very impressed with the quality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in the space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM level. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability, the access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines. We spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity issues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to the code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a clarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps deployed if it was not corrected. After our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they worked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the Aragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found. The biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this framework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly recommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review the code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend that the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful clarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of security that this framework is designed to provide. From the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed first iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is likely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired usage of the DApp developers.

Security checks Assets Threat Agents Operational Environment Common Security Problems Checklist 1. Introduction 1.1 About this review The primary focus of this audit was to analyze the aragonOS contracts. We focused our efforts on the Solidity contracts located at https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/v3.0.1/contracts (bf434fc6a0720bff091a5d3abfc1190e5ec3f342) For the aragon-apps we started at commit: https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/3542fea317c641f801cef6ca365f52fda97c7323 We concluded the audit by reviewing only the changes related to the initially found issues up to https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/be4522b264d2224279fbfe582f424f3c6c8d3c9b and https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/05bf9e858e5234429f13bda22b7db9f79cba2f9e . We assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as we could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code. Scope: Solidity Contracts We critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand. Solidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers. Out of Scope: As the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope: Actual business applications and real world scenarios. Documentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began) User interface and user experience. Deployment process. Even though the team went deep into solidity, we can not assume there are zero errors in the solidity compiler. 1.2 Disclaimer This document includes opinions and recommendations. All the opinions are our own and independent of the Aragon team. We found issues in the Solidity code and general design of system but that does not mean that we found all the issues. 1.3 Team Introduction Jordi Baylina < jordi@baylina.cat > @jbaylina Over 30 years experience as a developer, and over two years spent researching Ethereum.

When full, we feel the analysis is complete; when partial, we feel further analysis would be beneficial, and when supplemental we feel that the task is not in the scope of analysis but it has been also reviewed Type Description Depth Standard code review includes the common issues that are usually reviewed in all applications: code readability, specification matching, duplicated code, parameter checking, precondition assertions, code conventions, documentation, testing, code coverage, overflow/underflows, unused variables, bounds checking, etc... Full Ethereum security specifics Specific issues related to Solidity and the Ethereum execution environment, see Appendix A. Full Standards Standards fulfillment Full Standard security review Includes defining assets to be protected and checking STRIDE attacks on the system Partial Application logic Check if code logic matches with the expected behaviour defined in the documentation n/a (Crypto)Economics Checks for (crypto)economic points of failure, and weakness in punish/incentivization systems Supplemental Decentralization Checks for centralized points of failure Supplemental Simulation Simulate the system Supplemental Our findings are presented in the form V0##-XX, R00#-XX, and are specified in the Review Results section of the document, using the following pattern: Description Description of the finding Location Where is located (if applicable) Severity The threats have been classified into five groups (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Comment) depending on the impact and the likelihood of the event. Sometimes it is really complicated to guess the likelihood or the impact of the finding. We use OWASP threat classification. Unknown Likelihood Low Likelihood Medium Likelihood High Likelihood High Impact Medium Medium High Critical Medium impact Medium Low Medium High Low impact Comment Comment Low Medium Unknown Impact Medium Medium Medium Medium Status \u201cFixed\u201d means that the reviewing team considers that the issue has been repaired. \u201cNot fixed\u201d means that the issue is still present. Comments Our thoughts on the issue. The recommendations provided are not based on a detailed and deep analysis of the underlying problem, therefore they should be considered as a reference and not a definitive solution. 2.

Aragon team will temporarily remove this functionality in the next version. Description About https://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/evmscript/executors/DelegateScript.sol#L24 There is only one DelegateScript instance globally created in EVMScriptRegistryFactory . This DelegateScript has the public everybody callable method execScript(bytes _script, bytes _input, address[] _blacklist) . If the delegatecall-ed contract method contains a SELFDESTRUCT , the destructed contract will be the EVMScriptRegistryFactory baseDel instance which cannot be redeployed since it's not upgradable. About aragon/aragonOS#250 fix The fix, based on the assumption that a function that SELFDESTRUCTs called from a delegatecall never will return any data ( RETURNDATASIZE is 0 ), can be bypassed by doing an extra delegatecall jump, see the following exploit, based on current test mocks: contract DyingDelegatorHelper { function die() public returns (bool) { selfdestruct(0x0); return true; } } contract DyingDelegator is DelegateScriptTarget { function exec() public returns (bool) { DyingDelegatorHelper helper = new DyingDelegatorHelper(); address(helper).delegatecall(DyingDelegatorHelper(0).die.selector); return true; } } - Comments - Consider limiting DelegateScript callers to the EVMScriptRunner . 2.2 High Severity Issues [V002-HI] Irrevocable permissions Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol#L121 High os#211 Fixed Description By using require for permissions you can reach a situation where the permission depends on the parameters and you cannot revoke the permission because you don't check the specific parameters. Comments Should remove require permissions. [V003-HI] Function receiveApproval can exploit orgs/users with 0xFFF approval Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L157 High apps#83 Fixed. Description Currently, any user can call the receiveApproval function, moving another user\u2019s tokens if they have given a 0xFFF approval to the org. Because this is really a hook called by the token contract, only the token should be able to call receiveApproval . It is up to the token to have the necessary protections. Comments Consider adding a require(msg.sender == _token) . [V004-HI] Possible overflow in voteTime Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ aragon-apps/blob/master/a pps/voting/contracts/Voting .sol#L265 High apps#187 Fixed Description The voteTime parameter is the seconds that a vote will be open for token holders. When checking _isVoteOpen , it is possible that vote.startDate + voteTime will overflow. 2.3 Medium Severity Issues [V005-MD] Cannot easily view permissions Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol Medium os#251 Fixed Description For security and recovery situations a fast way to view permissions is necessary. Imagine a rogue employee starts moving funds. It would be good to be able to quickly see what other permissions that user has. Or if something strange is happening, being able to easily retrieve all permissions is helpful. Comments A getPermissionParams function would be very handy. Given entity, app, and role, tell me the parameters. [V006-MD] AppManager can upgrade a pinned app Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ kernel/Kernel.sol#L62 Medium Not fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Description There are two ways to get the baseCode for an app. Typically they would use AppProxy.getCode() . However if the proxy instance is registered with the kernel, you can fetch the app addr with kernel.getApp() . Thus if you register a AppProxyPinned instance with the kernel, then anywhere kernel.getApp is called to fetch the app address, it can be replaced with a new address by calling kernel.setApp . So the app isn't really pinned because it is replaceable. [V007-MD] CallScript buffer overflows Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ evmscript/executors/CallsScri pt.sol#L41 Medium os#263 Fixed Description Since no bounding checks are performed for _script pointer, you can read data beyond the limit of the length. Comments Check that calldataStart + calldataLength < _script.length to prevent buffer overflows. [V008-MD] Can create vote before initialize Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/tree/d9dff36a84ff95 6d21628de0e29423d967404 dc5/apps/voting/contracts/Vot ing.sol Medium apps#188 Fixed Description A newVote can be created and automatically executed without taking a vote if the voting contract has not been initialized. The worry is that this odd feature could be exploited by attackers. Here is an example: A deployer deploys a contract Attacker creates a proposal to send all funds to address X. The quorum for this will be zero. The attacker votes for this proposal using another address so that it can be executed later. But also needs to vote for it in the same block as the vote deadline is also 0. The deployer initializes the contract. and gives it access to move funds from a vault. The attacker executes the vote that they have already passed and takes all the funds. Comments Have a afterInitalize modifier. Or use a factory to deploy. 2.4 Low Severity Issues [V009-LW] Issues if Solidity is upgraded Location Severity Status Example: https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ kernel/Kernel.sol#L11 Low Not Fixed Documentation and tooling issue. Description Even though the likelihood of this event is \u201cvery low\u201d, we consider this issue of medium severity, to give an special attention to it. There are concerns about criteria changes in future solidity versions. The control that developers have on where the variables are stored is quite limited. Dependency on the multi-inheritance order on the definition of the class may variate the way state variables are stored. As an example, in Kernel, If we swap KernelStorage and Initializable it would break compatibility. This can easily happen in user defined apps and errors would be very difficult to detect causing all kinds of problems to those upgraded apps.

Comments May be a good idea if the isValidBump does not check the major version to allow patch fixing of previous ones.

Comments Using an assembly call to the ACLOracle and checking if the call succeeded or failed, will provide consistent handling of the params. May want to limit the gas provided to the ACLOracle as well. [V012-LW] Min period of 1 sec is too short Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L119 Low apps#240 Fixed Description Min period of 1 sec for finance purposes makes no sense and it is possible to get into race conditions where a payment can not be made (due to the fact that you can only advance 20 periods per tx). Comments A min period of 1 day should be more than enough. [V013-LW] _reference is lost for a single payment Location Severity Issue Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol# L220 Low apps#219 Fixed Description For a single payment in Finance app, you lose the _reference param. Comments Consider passing _reference to _makePaymentTransaction so the _reference is logged. [V014-LW] Race condition exists for payment recipients Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol Low Not Fixed No action will be taken. Inherent ethereum flaw. Description If an organization using the Finance app owes more money out to receivers than it has, then receivers may begin racing each other hoping to get to any funds first as soon as they are available using the receiverExecutePayment function. Comments Avoiding these kinds of races can be done by defining and implementing a better policy for payments when there is not enough money. Maybe prioritising older receivers or the ones with more reputation. Or may be allowing only to withdraw a portion of the funds. Any of these solutions may require a large development effort for something that may be complex and not worthy. So keeping the code as is, is probably the best decision at this stage, but users of this contract should be aware of this flaw. [V015-LW] Forward is too permissive Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/to ken-manager/contracts/Toke nManager.sol#L182 Low Not Fixed No action will be taken. Documentation issue. Description There are some great use cases for forwarding evm script functions. But this functionality should not be included as a general default with the TokenManager. It violates the single responsibility principle. It allows a function to return very different outputs. Comments This functionality might be better placed outside the TokenManager in a contract specifically designed for the specific use cases it is intended for. Creating multiple instances of employees or IDs are two examples. [V016-LW] Should not permit anything if no Kernel or ACL is defined Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ apps/AragonApp.sol#L29 Low Not Fixed See: https://github.com/aragon/aragon OS/issues/325 Documentation issue. Description The Kernel and ACL are central to the operation of Aragon apps and so apps should be able to expect that they are defined. If the Kernel or ACL are not defined, then nothing should be allowed. Comments Aragon\u2019s argument about this issue is that an application should be able to run in standalone mode (Without an ACL defined). This seems a little dangerous (but not an issue by itself) since this permits any operation when this variable is set to zero (the initial value). In any case, this should be very well documented in the code and in the usage handbook.

Comments The Finance app\u2019s initialize function should check vault and etherToken != 0 . Alternatively, it may be better to use kernel for vault and etherToken . In addition code has been changed since time of initial audit to no longer rely on an ethertoken as the vault has been generalized. The generalized changes to the vault have not been audited.

Comments ACL is based off of user input and test coverage does not extend to modifiers. Analyze the following example: create a parameter with LOGIC_OP_PARAM_ID = param.id . But with _param.op not equal to Op.IF_ELSE , Op.Not , Op.OR , Op.And,Op.XOR will result in r2 being returned when evalLogic gets called from evalParam bypassing the param.id check.

Comments Thus the function should not be marked as view . [V034-LW] Can't call send or transfer on aragon app Location Severity Issue Status Anywhere a delegate proxy is used Comment OS#281 Fixed (with new functionality that may need deeper review) Comment Send or transfer only permits 2300 gas but delegate proxy requires 10000 + execution costs. This means that you can not use the re-entrancy safe transfer and send methods provided by solidity to call an AragonApp. You would need to manually limit the gas with vault.call.gas(16000).value(msg.value)() . This issue, has been fixed recently in aragon/aragonOS!281 . Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality. The way it has been solved is by always accepting send and transfer calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism. This mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the eth_estimateGas function. Please, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed. 3. Recommendations 3.1 Architecture Comments [V035-CM] Failsafe mode Location Severity Status n/a Comment Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Comment Currently, if a fatal error occurs while deploying a new ACL or a faulty ACL is deployed, the kernel can become inoperative without the possibility of redeploying the ACL app. [V036-CM] Move ACL param logic to oracle Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol#285 Comment Not Fixed Comment The ACL param logic adds a lot of complexity to the ACL. In order to simplify such a critical component, consider moving the param logic to an ACLOracle. This way, the complexity is \u201copt in\u201d and a decision can be made on a DAO by DAO basis if they would like to include the ACL language or use a custom ACLOracle to handle permissions. [V037-CM] Isolate apps that are granted powerful permissions Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ acl/ACL.sol Comment Not Fixed Future improvement: aOS 4.0 Comment Related to V037-CM, there are a few permissions that are critical to the operation of the DAO. If these permissions fall into the wrong hands, they can break the entire DAO and any apps that share an ACL/Kernel. Sometimes these permissions are given to Apps within the DAO. A bug in 1 of these \u201cprivileged apps\u201d can affect the entire DAO. Consider deploying Apps that are granted powerful permissions with a separate kernel, when possible, in order to provide some sandboxing.

Contracts implementing EVMScriptRunner (AragonApp) make a delegatecall to the scriptExecutor. When this scriptExecutor is the DeployDelegateScript executor this cache variable will potentially conflict with the calling contracts storage in slot 0 , thus potentially leading to storage corruption and unexpected state. With the current AragonStorage layout, there is no conflict because cache is a mapping and thus stored in slot keccak256(\u20180\u2019 . index) and the first storage variable in AragonStorage is IKernel and stored in slot 0 .

In TokenManager app, use safe math for isBalanceIncreaseAllowed function. Appendix A. Security checks Assets Considered as threat targets, smart contracts and user interface application logic should enforce using the underlying Ethereum technology to guarantee the self-protection and non-by-passability of the access controls for the following assets: ETH Stored/transferred ether asserts TOKEN Stored/transferred token asserts (like ERC20) ACL Deployed permissions Upgradability Components (smartcontracts) upgradeability Core Isolation Applications are not allowed to modify core data App Isolation Applications are not allowed to modify data from other applications, only explicit communication channels can be used to share information between them. Threat Agents We use the following categories to understand who might attack the smart contracts: Accidental Discovery An ordinary user stumbles across a functional mistake in your application, just using a web browser, and gains access to privileged information or functionality. Privileged account mistake A mistake (e.g. client library failures or fat finger errors) performed from an account that has special privileges on the smart contracts. Automated Malware Programs or scripts, which are searching for known vulnerabilities, and then report them back to a central collection site. The Curious Attacker A security researcher or ordinary user, who notices something wrong with the application, and decides to pursue further. Script Kiddies Common renegades, seeking to compromise or deface applications for collateral gain, notoriety, or a political agenda. The Motivated Attacker Potentially, a disgruntled staff member with inside knowledge or a paid professional attacker. Whales Big economic agents abusing blockchain economic models for financial gain. Miners Miners abusing blockchain protocols for financial gain. Big Organizations Highly trained professionals and criminals cracking or abusing blockchain smart contracts and protocols for financial gain, reputation destruction or geopolitical cyber warfare. Operational Environment We use the following operative scenarios when analyzing threats: Normal operation Ethereum ecosystem is stable Network congestion High amount of pending transactions makes a Ethereum network congestion High volatility ETH/$ price is having a high volatility Fork A contentious fork of Ethereum that produces 2 seperate networks. Unexpected fatal bug / global settlement An unexpected critical bug is found on the smart contracts Subsystems failure Auxiliary subsystems (e.g. oracles) fails Operators failure Smart contract operators fails or delays the execution Whale attacks Economic whales gone wild Common Security Problems Checklist Trivial Errors Shadowing Misnamed variables Missing require guards Variable confusion String Literals/Magic Numbers Standards Conformity Tx.origin use Erroneous Constant State Functions Race Conditions Re-entrancy Recursion External/Cross Contract Calls Front Running Miner specific attacks Blocktime Attacks Transaction Reordering Attacks DoS Revert Block Gas Limit/Dynamic Loops Integer Overflow & Underflow Template Misuse/Plugin Trust Issues Dynamic Array Memory Manipulation ABI Length Encoding Exploit Forced Balance Manipulation Malicious Higher Order Bit Parameters Economic Attacks Unsolved Solidity Bugs Bad function access control Replay/nonce attacks Library initialization Post-deployment ACLs","title":"Audit (v1.4) by White Hat Group"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_whg01_report/#aragonos-code-review","text":"Download original PDF Jordi Baylina < jordi@baylina.cat > Barry Whitehat < barrywhitehat@protonmail.com > Adri\u00e0 Massanet < adria@codecontext.io > Arthur Lunn < Quazia@giveth.io > Oswald Jones < oz@giveth.io > RJ Ewing < perissology@protonmail.com > Griff Green < griff@giveth.io > Release V1.4 / 2018-06-22","title":"aragonOS Code Review"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_whg01_report/#executive-summary","text":"In February, Aragon asked us to do a code review for the aragonOS framework as well as the Finance, Vault, Voting and Token Manager applications. We were very impressed with the quality of the code. It is without question one of the most advanced smart contract systems in the space and makes extensive use of many new functionalities within Solidity and at the EVM level. Especially notable is the secure way to deploy a core controller that adds upgradability, the access control pattern (ACL) and its flexible execution engines. We spent 3 weeks in March reviewing the code and found 1 critical issue, 3 high severity issues, 4 medium severity issues and 27 low severity issues. We also made 39 comments to the code about things that could be improved or at least things that we believe require a clarification or a deeper look. The critical issue, if exploited, could stop all Aragon DApps deployed if it was not corrected. After our deep dive into the code, we discussed the issues with the Aragon team and they worked to fix all the issues throughout April. We reviewed these fixes and can say that the Aragon team has corrected all of the important security issues that we found. The biggest worry we have with this framework is the possible misunderstanding of this framework by the developers that decide to use it to deploy their DApps. We strongly recommend that all Aragon DApp developers, especially those that are early pioneers, review the code, try to understand how it works, and do not treat it as a black box. We recommend that the Aragon core team and community contributors make a special effort to add useful clarifications in the code. Better documentation will greatly contribute to the high level of security that this framework is designed to provide. From the architectural perspective, we believe that this code base is an incredibly well designed first iteration. However, after the first set of DApps are developed on top of this framework, it is likely that more improvements and refactors will need to be done to accommodate the desired usage of the DApp developers.","title":"Executive Summary"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_whg01_report/#table-of-contents","text":"Executive Summary Table of Contents 1.

We assembled a multidisciplinary team to get deep into the project and find as many issues as we could in the three weeks we set aside to review this code. Scope: Solidity Contracts We critically analyzed the aragonOS contracts and aragon-app contracts to understand the system. We ran local test deployments and created proof of concept apps to try out the aragon system first hand. Solidity audits are something our core team is most experienced in. We followed our pattern of searching for bugs and performing a critical review to ensure the code matches the intentions of the developers. Out of Scope: As the name implies, the aragonOS is meant to be a foundation layer for business application built on its ACL and kernel components. The following was not in scope: Actual business applications and real world scenarios. Documentation for business use cases (still underway when this review began) User interface and user experience.

However if the proxy instance is registered with the kernel, you can fetch the app addr with kernel.getApp() . Thus if you register a AppProxyPinned instance with the kernel, then anywhere kernel.getApp is called to fetch the app address, it can be replaced with a new address by calling kernel.setApp .

The worry is that this odd feature could be exploited by attackers. Here is an example: A deployer deploys a contract Attacker creates a proposal to send all funds to address X. The quorum for this will be zero. The attacker votes for this proposal using another address so that it can be executed later. But also needs to vote for it in the same block as the vote deadline is also 0. The deployer initializes the contract. and gives it access to move funds from a vault.

[V014-LW] Race condition exists for payment recipients Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/fi nance/contracts/Finance.sol Low Not Fixed No action will be taken. Inherent ethereum flaw. Description If an organization using the Finance app owes more money out to receivers than it has, then receivers may begin racing each other hoping to get to any funds first as soon as they are available using the receiverExecutePayment function. Comments Avoiding these kinds of races can be done by defining and implementing a better policy for payments when there is not enough money. Maybe prioritising older receivers or the ones with more reputation. Or may be allowing only to withdraw a portion of the funds. Any of these solutions may require a large development effort for something that may be complex and not worthy. So keeping the code as is, is probably the best decision at this stage, but users of this contract should be aware of this flaw. [V015-LW] Forward is too permissive Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gon-apps/blob/master/apps/to ken-manager/contracts/Toke nManager.sol#L182 Low Not Fixed No action will be taken. Documentation issue. Description There are some great use cases for forwarding evm script functions. But this functionality should not be included as a general default with the TokenManager. It violates the single responsibility principle. It allows a function to return very different outputs. Comments This functionality might be better placed outside the TokenManager in a contract specifically designed for the specific use cases it is intended for. Creating multiple instances of employees or IDs are two examples. [V016-LW] Should not permit anything if no Kernel or ACL is defined Location Severity Status https://github.com/aragon/ara gonOS/blob/v3.0.1/contracts/ apps/AragonApp.sol#L29 Low Not Fixed See: https://github.com/aragon/aragon OS/issues/325 Documentation issue. Description The Kernel and ACL are central to the operation of Aragon apps and so apps should be able to expect that they are defined. If the Kernel or ACL are not defined, then nothing should be allowed. Comments Aragon\u2019s argument about this issue is that an application should be able to run in standalone mode (Without an ACL defined). This seems a little dangerous (but not an issue by itself) since this permits any operation when this variable is set to zero (the initial value). In any case, this should be very well documented in the code and in the usage handbook.

But with _param.op not equal to Op.IF_ELSE , Op.Not , Op.OR , Op.And,Op.XOR will result in r2 being returned when evalLogic gets called from evalParam bypassing the param.id check.

[V034-LW] Can't call send or transfer on aragon app Location Severity Issue Status Anywhere a delegate proxy is used Comment OS#281 Fixed (with new functionality that may need deeper review) Comment Send or transfer only permits 2300 gas but delegate proxy requires 10000 + execution costs. This means that you can not use the re-entrancy safe transfer and send methods provided by solidity to call an AragonApp. You would need to manually limit the gas with vault.call.gas(16000).value(msg.value)() . This issue, has been fixed recently in aragon/aragonOS!281 . Please note that this PR also includes the token recoverability functionality. The way it has been solved is by always accepting send and transfer calls with ETH and then creating a mechanism for token recovery including ETH. This mechanism may complicate the contracts aimed to receive ETH by default, and any other application that will have to define a token. Aragon App developers must be very aware of this mechanism. This mechanism may also bring some issues with clients using the eth_estimateGas function. Please, also note that this functionality was not part of this code review and has not been fully reviewed.","title":"2.4 Low Severity Issues"},{"location":"association/security/audits/audit_whg01_report/#3-recommendations","text":"","title":"3.

In order to simplify such a critical component, consider moving the param logic to an ACLOracle.

If these permissions fall into the wrong hands, they can break the entire DAO and any apps that share an ACL/Kernel. Sometimes these permissions are given to Apps within the DAO. A bug in 1 of these \u201cprivileged apps\u201d can affect the entire DAO.

Contracts implementing EVMScriptRunner (AragonApp) make a delegatecall to the scriptExecutor. When this scriptExecutor is the DeployDelegateScript executor this cache variable will potentially conflict with the calling contracts storage in slot 0 , thus potentially leading to storage corruption and unexpected state. With the current AragonStorage layout, there is no conflict because cache is a mapping and thus stored in slot keccak256(\u20180\u2019 . index) and the first storage variable in AragonStorage is IKernel and stored in slot 0 .

Flock What is Flock? Following our work on decentralizing the development of the Aragon project , we have created the Flock program. The aim of the program is to handle the initial application and pre-selection process for new Aragon teams . This program will be run by the Aragon Association and representatives of the different teams that are already part of the Aragon project. Scope The focus of the program is the selection of independent teams that will work on the core components and products of the Aragon project. The funds are intended to cover: The operation costs for the research, development, and maintenance of the Aragon products and ecosystem for the period of one year, and An incentivization package in ANT Application process The application process is open and public and it will take place in this dedicated GitHub repository. If you expect your proposal to be approved in the next Aragon Network Vote you should submit your proposal to the Flock program at least one month before Aragon Governance Proposals are due , to give reviewers enough time to properly consider your proposal. You can find information about dates for the next Aragon Network Vote on the Governance page in the Aragon Wiki. How to submit your proposal - Fork the Aragon Flock GitHub repository - Create a new directory with the team\u2019s name inside the teams/ folder - Inside the directory, create one file: proposal.md ( see proposal guide ), where you present the overall application and team - Create a pull request to merge your submission into the Flock repository. In that pull request fill in all the relevant info described in the template - Amendments to the initial proposal can be made by creating a pull request over the existent pull request for the relevant review. The Aragon Association and representatives of the current Aragon teams will review and approve the relevant applications but the community is invited to participate in the public discussion that will take place in the comments of the relevant pull request. After approval by the Aragon Association, teams must submit a Finance track proposal requesting funding via AGP-1 and ANT holders will approve or reject such proposals. Grant Size Operation costs Part of the funding is intended to cover the annual operating cost of each team. The minimum amount of funds available for operations is $300K paid in ETH or DAI. Incentivization package To align the interests of the teams with the creation of value of the Aragon Network, increase the team motivation and incentivize long term commitment, every team will be given an incentivization package in ANT. This incentivization package gives the team governance power over the project and the potential for greater financial upside. This incentive will be subject to vesting. After the definitive approval of funding as per the AGP-1 process, funds for operating costs will be disbursed to the approved teams in a lump sum or in tranches. Decision rationale Decisions are made by the Aragon Association in a process which includes gathering opinions from members of the independent teams that are already full-time contributors to the Aragon project.

The Pando Network team has been working closely with the Aragon ecosystem for almost a year now and has been the recipient of two Aragon Nest grants: [ 1 & 2 ]. To strengthen its commitment to the Aragon movement, the Pando Network team has decided to apply to the Flock program as Aragon Black . This first Flock proposal covers six months of work. However, if the Aragon community lends us its trust, we intend to re-apply to this program on the long run. Our long term vision is to turn Aragon into the go-to choice to decentralize the governance of open-source projects and common goods . Thus, our work will focus on a. providing the tools to experiment with new economic dynamics [I01] ; b. providing the tools to maintain open-source projects over Aragon [I02] [I03] ; c. improve some core components of the Aragon stack [I04] and ; d. on-board non-tech-savvy people and real common-driven projects into the Aragon Ecosystem [I05] . To cover its operating costs for six months [Q3 & Q4 2019] and contribute creating a thriving Aragon ecosystem, Aragon Black requests: $450k paid in DAI [or any other stable assets]. 125k ANT for incentivization purposes. Note. AGP quarterly votes happen at the end of each quarter. Thus, even if this Flock proposal intends to be submitted to the Q2 2019 AGP vote, its funds would [hopefully] cover our operating costs for Q3 & Q4 2019. If this proposal makes it through the ballot, we intend to re-submit a longer proposal at the Q4 2019 AGP vote. Note. This proposal introduces the short-term outputs we intend to deliver by the end of 2019. Besides these immediates deliverables, we are also working on providing long-term sustainability to the Aragon ecosystem. As the leads to achieve this sustainability are still under heavy discussion within the community, we won't discuss their details in this proposal. For a deeper view, these leads are synthesized in a forum post here . Deliverables We are splitting deliverables across the following initiatives: I01 - Fundraising The goal of this topic is to provide a library and a standalone dApp any Aragon DAO can use to raise funds through a Continuous Funding scheme. 2019 deliverables Fundraising library. Develop a modular fundraising library providing low-level building-blocks: curves, taxation mechanisms, withdrawal mechanisms, etc. Fundraising app. Develop an opinionated but ready-to-use fundraising app - based on the previous library - implementing the Apiary scheme designed by @lkngtn . Longer-term deliverables Fee and signaling. Design and discuss a token economics model for Apiary, relying on buy / sell orders fee and an ANT-based staking mechanism for DAO signaling. Discovery platform. Develop an Aragon Network wide fundraising platform allowing Aragon users to discover and join new DAOs. Resources A PoC of such a fundraising app is already available here and demoed here . I02 - aragonPM The goal of this initiative is to enhance aragonPM to the point where it become a serious - and backward compatible - alternative to NPM. 2019 deliverables Frontend. Develop a dApp allowing to easily search and browse through aragonPM registries and repos [an aragonPM equivalent to npmjs.com ]. NPM compatibility. Develop an enhanced version of aragonPM-serve complying with the NPM Registry API to enforce aragonPM - NPM compatibility. Longer-term deliverables Linking fee and insurance . Design and discuss an ANT-based token economics model for aragonPM registries, relying on linking fees and an insurance system. pando | aragonPM. Develop a common contribution and dependency tracking system shared by aragonPM and pando to serve as the foundation of a possible token-economic model for aragonPM repos. I03 - Aragon Development Infrastructure The goal of this initiative is to drive Aragon's development to a higher degree of decentralization thanks to pando [a decentralized VCS our team as been working on for the last past year thanks to the Nest program]. 2019 deliverables Pando. Keep on developing and enhancing the pando protocol and all related DAO templates for mainnet launch. Experimentation. Experiment using pando to host non-sensitive Aragon repositories: documentation, Aragon Monthly, etc. Longer-term deliverables Contribution economics. Work closely with all the other Aragon teams to design [and experiment with] possible reward systems for Aragon contributors. GitHub drop-out. Support Aragon teams in experimenting with pando to gradually migrate Aragon codebase to a fully decentralized infrastructure. PandoHub / AragonHub. Ship everything we have learned in this initiative into a ready-to-use decentralized alternative to GitHub. Custom Open Source licence. Deliver of a fork of the Contributive Commons Licence in order to implement an isomorphism between DAOs governance rules - as defined through blockchain-based smart contracts - and nation-states juridical frameworks. Resources You can have a quick overview of Pando by watching the talk we gave at AraCon and try our Rinkeby app by reading our announcement and watching our demo/tutorial . I04 - Generics | Aragon Stack The Aragon Black team is committed to help improving the existing Aragon stack in every aspect it entails with a particular focus on the following topics. Monolithic app. Work closely with all the other Aragon team to allow Aragon apps to handle multiple contracts. CLI apps. Enhance the aragonCLI to potentially serve as a foundational layer for aragon-related node / CLI apps. Resources Work as already been undertaken in collaboration with the Aragon Mesh team regarding the extensibility of the aragon CLI. More informations are available in this forum post . I05 - Generics | Aragon Community / Ecosystem The Aragon Black team is committed to help extend the existing Aragon community / ecosystem and spread the philosophy of Aragon's manifesto in every aspect it entails with a particular focus on the following topics. 2019 deliverables On-boarding. Help on-board common-driven organizations [political organizations, artistic organizations, cooperatives, etc.] into the Aragon ecosystem to develop real-world use cases. Interviews / theorization. Manage interviews with and publications from \u00ab outsiders \u00bb of our crypto-ecosystem: political activists, philosophers, etc. Aragon Black has a long experience in the publishing / journalism field. We thus intend to launch a dedicated blog to drive dialogues and theorization experimentations around the DAO / crypto landscape. Book. Publish, at the end of this year, a book compiling these articles [under a CC licence] to offer the Aragon ecosystem more visibility outside of the crypto-space. Longer-term deliverables Aragon / pando based publishing platform. Develop a Medium-like dApp based on Aragon / pando allowing to \u00ab thank \u00bb and reward authors, proofreaders, etc. through an Aragon DAO linked token. Grant size We would like to request $450k paid in DAI to cover the operating costs of Q3 & Q4 2019. These funds would be used as follow. Estimated operating costs for Q2 and Q3 2019 Type Description Amount Payroll $410k Contractors DevOps | Design | Legal | etc. $10k Services GitHub | Google Suite | Chat | etc. $5k Travel Offsites | Conferences | etc. $10k Equipment Laptop | etc. $15k Total $450k ANT package We would like to request 25k ANT per team member per year for incentivization purpose, i.e. 125k ANT for this six months long proposal. We are committed to the Aragon Network in the long-term and therefore accept a 4-years vesting schedule. Team The team will be comprised of 10 people distributed as follow. This team is partly remote and distributed across Europe. We will thus hold quarterly offsites to gather together.

The team intends to continue the work on the project. To cover our operation costs and continue creating a thriving Aragon ecosystem, Aragon One requests: $4 million paid in DAI (or other stable assets) for 2019, for operational costs. 1,675,000 ANT vested over the next 4 years, for the long-term incentivization of the current team and future employees. Deliverables We are splitting deliverables across initiatives, which are grouped by topic. All deliverables that don\u2019t fit into these initiatives have been split into their own categories (e.g. aragonOS, aragonSDK). I01 \u2013 Identity experience The goal is to build an identity experience that is seamless and allows individuals and organizations to create and manage their decentralized, self-soverign identities, ensuring pseudonymity, while being secure and frictionless to use across apps in the Aragon platform and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. This identity-related information should include several attributes like name, ENS domain, avatar, bio. Focus areas for this initiative: Individual identity : Allow individuals to create and manage their user profile, mapping their address to a human readable ENS name that can be used to interact with apps within the organization. Organization identity & membership support : Allow users to create and manage their organizations\u2019 profiles, providing an intuitive way to add members to a given organization and granting them permissions & privileges. Related GitHub issues: aragon/design#9 aragon/aragon-ui#156 aragon/design#3 aragon/design#13 aragon/design#5 I02 \u2013 Agent application This application will enable organizations to interact natively with other web3 applications (including other Aragon organizations). Related GitHub issue Related forum post I03 \u2013 App Center experience The App Center will allow users to discover, get and manage apps developed by Aragon and third party app developers, using the aragonSDK and the platform infrastructure. Having an App Center will also facilitate the creation of custom organizations and the customization of already deployed ones. Focus areas for this initiative: Upgrading apps : Provide users with a secure way to install new app versions, fixes for features or enhancements to already installed/in use apps. Browsing, installing & uninstalling apps : Enhance app discovery and app management for end users. Monetization/incentivisation model for app developers : Provide app developers with different monetisation models to create revenue from the apps they publish in the Aragon App Center. Related GitHub issues: aragon/design#17 aragon/aragonOS#151 I04 \u2013 Flexible permissions The aim of this initiative is to increase the richness and flexibility of the existing aragonOS permissioning system, allowing users to set and manage different thresholds for permissions on specific actions and delegate organizational responsibilities through permissions. Focus areas for this initiative: Stateful permissions : Allow users to set and manage time-based and use-based permissions. UI for conditional permissions : the ACL in aragonOS 4 supports conditional permissions through permission parametrization, the Permissions app should display and allow to edit parameters. Budgeting app : Enable organizations to plan and control their financial resources by setting time based permissions like budgeting. Related GitHub issue I05 \u2013 Responsive experience Improve the overall user experience of the platform and core apps by making the UI render well on any form factor, mobile wallet and browser, so users can seamlessly create, access and manage organizations. Focus areas for this initiative: Responsive UI : Make the platform and core apps responsive so Aragon can be used from mobile browsers such as Status or Coinbase Wallet. Native mobile app : Build native (probably React Native makes the most sense) mobile Aragon clients so we can benefit from device and OS specific capabilities. Related GitHub issue I06 \u2013 Blockchain abstraction The aim of this initiative is to lower the barrier of entry for adoption by allowing new users to immediately access functionality and perform actions without having to pay transactions fees. Focus areas for this initiative: Meta-transactions & relayers Improving onboarding for organizations Related GitHub issue I07 \u2013 New voting architecture Redesign the current voting architecture and experience to accommodate new voting mechanisms and support for existing standard tokens in Aragon Voting apps. Focus areas for this initiative: Voting with ERC20 tokens : Enable users to vote using ERC20 tokens. Solidify Research on Transaction and Vote relayers as a network service : Current research has shown that Meta-transactions and EVM storage proofs could provide a way to improve the cost and user experience of voting by relying on a network of bonded transaction and vote relayers. This research would explore the potential of Transaction and Vote Relaying as another fee generating service maintained by the Aragon Network. UX & technical research : Create a plan to research the needs and run a pilot with 0x \u2013 Use case: AGP-1 + Representative Council(s) Research and develop new Voting mechanisms. I08 \u2013 Dispute resolution (Aragon Network) Agreements app Aragon Agreements are a core component of the Aragon Network, they enable users to define human readable obligations and lock collateral to provide assurances to their counter-parties. Proposal agreements Proposal Agreements enhance the Aragon Client enabling organizations to leverage agreements to improve governance outcomes by requiring members to collateralized an agreement in order to submit proposals. Subjective proposal agreements can help avoid 51% attacks in DAOs by making sure that only proposals that are valid by the organization\u2019s charter can be voted on and executed. Aragon Court The Aragon Court is a service protocol designed to incentivize honest arbitration of agreements in exchange for arbitration fees. The court operates as an arbitration oracle which can be referenced in an agreement and used to resolve disputes. This deliverable includes the Aragon Court protocol, an interface for users of the court to review and manage agreements and disputes, and an interface for jurors to participate in the arbitration process. Fees are generated for the Aragon Network and participating jurors whenever an agreement adds the court as an arbiter and when creating or appealing a dispute. Solidify Research and Propose Policies for ANT Monetary Policy ANT is intended to be used for governance and as the native currency for the network. In order to optimize ANT for these uses adjustments to ANT\u2019s monetary policy may be necessary. This research would (1) explore the impact of creating a liquidity reserve and treasury bonds to tightly couple the networks assets with the valuation of ANT and (2) the feasibility of shifting the realization value appreciation to unit count rather than unit price using a scalar value token structure. aragonOS Global emergency failsafe Provide an opt-in failsafe for organizations and individual apps to safely freeze their state during times of emergency As a new system built on highly experimental technology, it is highly desirable to include failsafes in the event of security breaches or other emergency events. Organizations should be able to opt-in their entire organization or a particular set of applications to a failsafe that freezes their state and execution when triggered. Related GitHub issue Decouple aragonPM implementation Logically separate aragonPM\u2019s implementation from aragonOS Rather than being a core part of aragonOS, aragonPM is a use case that is built on top of the framework. aragonSDK Continuously improve developer experience We should reduce time for developers to start using the aragonSDK ( aragon/aragon-cli#203 ) and also add features they request to it. Increase capabilities of app sandbox Provide more APIs for Aragon app developers to use, including both UI controls (e.g. notifications, toast messages) as well as messaging and data controls (e.g. network state, action triggers). Aragon apps should also be extended to allow for multiple contracts to be used with one frontend (\u201cmonolithic apps\u201d). Split aragonUI and Lorikeet Push Lorikeet as an ecosystem-wide project, while still providing an Aragon-opinionated experience with aragonUI. Maintain developer documentation and port it over to the new website design system Take care of reviewing developer documentation when needed, and design and implement a new developer portal that aligns with the current design system we use for aragon.org. Aragon Infrastructure Maintain and continue improving the infrastructure that supports the client: the Ethereum nodes, IPFS nodes and apm-serve. Some of these improvements include: Monitoring tools and pager type systems so we are the first to know when something is down Increase reliability and uptime of the system Improve performance and lower down infrastructure costs Also, we commit to administering DNS and ENS domains, and maintaining the software for the Aragon forum, the Aragon chat, and the Aragon project blog. We expect the Aragon Association to cover costs related to hosting, servers and set up, and we just commit to maintainance when needed. Aragon Community Assist with user questions and feedback across official channels Assist in the transition to decentralized governance Help keep the community informed of announcements and recent developments Organize meetups to increase awareness of Aragon and foster community Contribute to documentation about the Aragon project and products in the wiki Aragon Communications Extend the new website design language to the rest of the Aragon websites Lead coordination with the community and other teams for content creation Communicate relevant product and other updates, releases and announcements Help integrate other teams into project communications flow as necessary Maintain general the Aragon wiki Help sponsor and attend relevant events as per the Event Policy Lead in spreading awareness of Aragon and decentralized organizations Aragon Nest and Flock Help with the application processes when needed Increase developer mindshare to attract teams to the Nest and Flock programs Lead the transition of the Nest program to a DAO Establish key non-obvious metrics for increasing Aragon adoption Help creating and maintaining a healthy Aragon ecosystem Grant size Estimated operating costs for 2019 We would like to request $4 million paid in DAI to cover the operating costs of 2019. To justify our request, and keeping in mind we had an average of 13 people in the team, we provide the main historical data of the operating cost for 2018: Payroll and business reimbursements: $1.25m Travel expenses: $190k, including travel to represent Aragon Contractors (lawyers, HR, design): $150k Team offsites: $100k Infrastructure and services: $10k Work equipment: $40k The estimated operating cost for 2019, keeping in mind we aim to expand the team to 25 is: Payroll and business reimbursements: $3m Travel expenses: $300k Contractors (lawyers, HR): $170k Team offsites: $250k Infrastructure and services: $25k Office: $55k Work equipment: $50k Video producing: $20k Office furniture and renovation costs: $130k That adds up to $4m. ANT package We would like to request 1,675,000 ANT, with 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting. This ANT package will be primarily used to incentivize employees, by giving them ANT packages as well. Our current commitments with the team are around 800k ANT, which would represent around 50% of the 1,675,000 ANT we request. We think this ANT grant will enable us to double our team while maintaining sustainable ANT packages for new employees, and possibly leaving a pool aside for future unexpected use. We are committed to the Aragon Network in the long-term and therefore want a 4-year vesting schedule.

To us, complex mega-projects can mean autonomous cities, next-generation transportation systems, solving sustainable development goals, redesigning the United Nations, or even building spaceships. There are common tools needed that will meet the primary coordination use case across all of these sectors: this can be evidenced by enterprise software companies such as Oracle and SAP building generic systems that are adopted across industries. We will be calling this Aragon suite of project and human-coordination tools Open Enterprise, as DAOs that are solving mega-projects are the definition of an open enterprise. In building Open Enterprise, we plan to also work as consultants for other decentralized organizations that intend to become (or currently are) DAOs to build custom implementations, and also determine common requirements, so we can drive the suite toward meeting the 80% use case. The Open Enterprise roadmap will be a continuation of the Planning Suite, with an additional focus of assessing the existing Aragon App ecosystem as a whole to develop common design patterns and components for the optimal cross-application user experience. This may require special application forks, and moving features from one app to another. Privacy , internationalization , and accessibility are three important pillars of our organization, and will be the pillars in which we plan to uphold the Aragon Manifesto. The Manifesto states \" we are committed to a world in which every person can participate in these new organizational structures\" . We interpret this to mean that we need to ensure these tools can indeed be used by everyone . Hence, Open Enterprise will: - Support communities that need to coordinate collective action in a more private manner. For this use case, we need to research the best technological architecture that can support censorship-resistant private projects. - Be usable by all languages that want to adopt the tools. This means the front-end framework should support right-to-left languages. In addition to modifying the front-end to support this mode, it will also entail driving Aragon App standards to move away from hard-coded display text, and instead toward strings that reference distributed storage layers. These strings can be collectively translated to create new language packs that meet the demands of the network. - Meet accessibility standards. Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. Hence we should modify Aragon architecture to support various accessibility modes. While these specific features are not on our immediate roadmap, they will be targets we strive towards as an organization. We see the adoption of Aragon and Open Enterprise as a way of expediting the future of work and society; one tailored around worker-autonomy, solidarity, reclaiming freedom, reclaiming land, and ultimately the stewardship for Planet Earth and all of its citizens. Deliverables First, we need to build common building blocks for the Aragon ecosystem that makes collaboration and coordination more seamless. We are splitting deliverables across initiatives, which are grouped by topic. I01 - Cross-Application User Experience aragonAPI A major limitation of the Aragon architecture is the tight coupling between an individual application front-end and contract. With this limitation, there is less freedom to design feature sets with the optimal user experience, where multiple contracts may be more logical for a single application. To improve upon the architecture, aragonAPI will be modified so as to support both relationships between a single app front-end and multiple contracts, as well as add tools to allow for contract data to be displayed across multiple user interfaces without coupling at the contract level. Once the flow has been defined within aragonAPI we will create at least one example of how we see ideal one-to-many and many-to-one relationships working. Expanded Forwarder Options Currently the forwarder is mainly designed to pass isolated actions where the forwarder has little to no knowledge of the forwarded action. We will research potential ways to expand its usability by creating additional specifications for script execution. This will allow for more tightly coupled forwarder interactions where the forwarded call data can actually be leveraged and modified within the Forwarder contract. At minimum we will design the specification and implement it in aragonOS for forwarder interactions that expect data to be passed between the forwarding and forwarder contracts at the contract level. I02 - Contextual Discussions Many applications throughout Aragon would benefit from contextual discussions or commenting. For example, if there is a transaction displayed in the Finance app, a member of the organization may be interested in beginning a discussion related to a transaction in the table. Additionally, Votes, Surveys, and Range Votes will all benefit from having the discussion located within Aragon. At the high level, discussion capabilities will have: - Ability to add, edit and delete comments - Support for markdown - Ability to like comments, weighted by the amount of DAO\u2019s tokens held at time of snapshot based on context We will ensure that the work we do in enhancing aragonAPI will enable us to support this use case, and will deliver at least one fork of an existing app that has integrated discussions. I03 - Rich User Profiles While Aragon One\u2019s identity app will provide much-needed features; an identity is more than a name, bio, ENS domain, and avatar. We propose to expand identities to allow for more rich profiles. This will be useful as the network of organizations within Aragon grows and a freelancer culture develops. This supplementary data can be useful in assessing allegiances, expertise, and clout. The additional data elements that will be relevant to expose in relation to a profile can be: - Memberships to other Aragon DAOs - Work Experience - Ability to import data from LinkedIn or manually input work experience - Ability to import commit history from Github, highlighting top projects - Ability to curate an portfolio of images (such as design work) hosted on distributed storage While we are aware 3box is developing \u201cEthereum Profiles\u201d which may cover aspects of this initiative, we will perform an assessment to see if it makes sense to leverage their framework before going all in on a fully custom implementation. I04 - Expanding Governance Possibilities Reputation System Implementing a reputation system within Aragon will expand governance possibilities and allow the usage of Aragon for reputation-based governance without requiring the integration of external applications such as Colony or DAOstack which can add security risks. The most logical place to implement the reputation system will be within the Projects application. To support reputation, changes to the Token Manager will be required, to allow minting a special type of quasi-transferable tokens that can be transferred only by a whitelist of addresses (e.g. the Standard Bounties contract or a specific Aragon application). Additionally, the Projects app will have to be enhanced to allow multiple tokens to be allocated to bounties. The end goal is that when a user completes a task using the Projects app, they can collect a variety of tokens -- standard ERC-20s in addition to non-transferable reputation tokens. DAO Templates At the moment, there are only two templates: Multisig and Democracy. To expand governance possibilities and allow for an easier user experience when a new DAO is being deployed, it will be beneficial to develop additional templates for the ecosystem. As part of this initiative we aim to create one additional template that will support reputation-based organizations. I05 - Data Storage and Standards Discussion forums, rich user profiles, and other familiar collaboration features are unique because they rely on data that is not efficiently stored on Ethereum. Our long term goal is to support these features with completely distributed storage while maintaining capabilities like optimal querying and dynamic access control. We\u2019ll start with a \u201cweb 2.5\u201d storage solution, learn more about users while relevant technologies mature, and remove intermediate services over time. DAOs should be able to store their data with these qualities: Accessible \u2014 all data from discussions and features alike will be available in distributed storage. This allows anyone to view and backup work without hitting a centralized server. Standardized \u2014 by content addressing data and following open data standards, we can make people\u2019s work more compatible across DAOs and other open source projects. Timestamped \u2014 contributors should be able to create snapshots of their work across platforms. One way to do this is to store data on IPFS and write the hash to Ethereum. Short Term Next 6 months - Immediate support for discussions and profiles A near term storage solution preserves important qualities of decentralization without jeopardizing technical feasibility or user experience. It has a distributed data layer (i.e. IPFS) with intermediate services running on top of it. These services should be open source and provide clients efficient read/write capabilities to/from distributed storage. Our initial architecture will likely have a distributed data store with intermediate services on top for caching, indexing, and writing to distributed storage. Although clients can always fetch data directly from distributed storage, our intermediate services will give enhanced access to it. We\u2019ll also be exploring how events relating to DAOs from centralized apps and Ethereum could be captured and displayed within Aragon apps. Some example events could include GitHub commits, issue comments, external forum discussion, etc. Over time we can replace intermediate services with their distributed counterparts such as OrbitDB, BigChainDB, Threads, Solid and others. Part of our goal over the next six months will be to better understand the feasibility of using these technologies. Long Term 12 - 24 months - Iterating and upgrading to \u201cweb 3.0\u201d While intermediate services still will be useful in the near-term, they should become less necessary as we implement distributed databases. At this point we will have new information about the community and their needs. If the demand for removing all centralization is high, a reliable distributed storage solution is feasible in this timeframe. Conversely, if we find the community cares more about new features we will be well positioned to extend our short term strategy and build more services. We understand that some things move quickly in this space while others take longer than expected so we are purposefully keeping our long term plans flexible. (Note: The images above are our initial architecture sketches. We\u2019ll continue to refine these, especially during the first month of work.) I06 - DAO Identity Organizations and entities have unique brands, which help them differentiate from one another and convey a fine-tuned message. One value add for the Aragon platform will be to provide features that allows an Organization to showcase their unique identity. At the moment, Organization avatars are the only way to differentiate. With the DAO Identity initiative, this will be expanded by allowing a DAO to tailor the branding and theme of the Aragon platform and also providing a user guide for self-hosted domains. To kickstart this, we will: - Design at least three additional themes (including dark mode) and enhance the Organization Settings to support switching between themes - Enhance the Organization Settings to support changing the background image (at the moment it\u2019s an Eagle) - Develop a simple read-only \u201cAbout\u201d Aragon App where the DAO can input and display their manifesto, mission statement, values, code of conduct, contact information - Write a user guide for hack.aragon.org that describes how to deploy Aragon to a self-hosted domain Eventually, the long-term goal for this initiative is to move toward a \u201cWordpress for DAOs\u201d experience, with a rich library of themes and many ways to easily customize layouts. To support this ultimate vision, we will begin research to assess any architectural changes required. I07 - Rewards Application and Planning Suite This Flock proposal includes team members that were awarded a Nest grant for a Planning Suite, which contains five applications: Allocations, Range Voting, Address Book, Projects, Rewards. The plan is to finish Milestone 3 by the end of January, before the Flock funding would begin. This Flock proposal includes rolling up Milestone 4 and 5 into Flock which entails the Rewards app, and any final \u201cclean up\u201d to get the Planning Suite into a stage to launch. Since we are rolling up Milestone 4 and 5 into this proposal, that means that we will not get paid those additional milestones which value to $40,000. Instead, the team will be paid via Flock payroll. Since the completion of the Planning Suite overlaps with the timeline of this Flock proposal, we think it makes sense to roll up the remaining work as it will be delivered more expediently with more full-time team members. Grant Size Estimated operating costs for Q1-Q2 2019 We would like to request $390,000 paid in DAI to cover 26 weeks of operating costs (February 3 rd to August 3 rd 2019). Autark payroll for 6 full-timers (includes healthcare stipend) - $295,000 Open Work Labs partnership (40 hrs/wk- details in team section) - $60,000 Contractors (Accounting, Graphic Design, etc) - $10,000 Misc. (Equipment, SaaS software/hosting, co-working space memberships, contingency) - $10,000 Team Offsite (One total) - $15,000 If we underspend for the Contractors, Misc., and Off-site categories, the budget will be rolled over to the subsequent grant period or returned to Aragon if we do not get approved for a subsequent grant. We will transparently document expenses. ANT package We would like to request an additional 350,000 ANT to incentivize the 6 full-time Autark members funded by this proposal, distributed over 4 years of work. This ANT will have a 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting. Any additional ANT we request in the future will be for new team members. Organization Structure Autark will initially be a remote team of independent contractors, but assuming we prove ourselves to the Aragon Network, we plan to eventually build a local team in Berlin to complement the remote team. Berlin is becoming one of the largest crypto hubs in the world, with a strong community passionate about decentralized organizations. Team Autark The Autark team will be comprised of 6 full-timers and will initially be fully remote and distributed across the world, primarily in Europe and America.

Github: ottodevs We will have a job opening for one new hire We will have an open position for an additional full-time web3 developer and are including this in our budget, but the budget can be allocated to us after we secure the developer. We want this flexibility to add one additional resource especially if that resource will be needed to deliver on our proposal. We have learned from our Nest experience that estimating roadmaps are challenging, especially when working on a very early dapp framework with many moving parts. Hence having the financial leeway to take action and adapt is important. Based on if and when we onboard this resource, it may affect our scope. We plan to revisit the scope at a 13 week check-in point. We do not plan on dedicating that much time to recruitment beyond following up on inbound leads and mentioning the open role at the bottom of our blog posts, unless it becomes highly critical that the resource is needed to fully deliver on our proposal. Technical hiring process After an initial interview with the candidate to make sure they mesh well with our team and have aligned values, we will open up the second stage which tests their technical skills. This will require the candidate successfully develop one aspect of our roadmap, in a bounty-like manner. Please refer to this example , although this may not be the specific bounty we publicize inititially. The way it would work is that if we merge their pull request for the bounty, they will get rewarded for their contribution in addition to a job offer. Partner Organization In addition to the Autark team, we are establishing a relationship with a partner organization, Open Work Labs. Three engineers from Open Work Labs will work on a contract basis and we have budgeted for a maximum of 40 hours a week (1 FT equivalent) of software development, devops, and technical direction for the Data and Storage Standards initiative which bleeds into other initiatives such as Contextual Discussions and Rich Profiles. Two of them are also ConsenSys engineers with experience developing and implementing such solutions. This expertise will round out the skills of the Autark team, ensuring that we lay a solid foundation for our deliverables. They are committed to building a long lasting relationship with Autark and Aragon in the case of continued Flock funding.

To us, complex mega-projects can mean autonomous cities, next-generation transportation systems, solving sustainable development goals, redesigning the United Nations, or even building spaceships. There are common tools needed that will meet the primary coordination use case across all of these sectors: this can be evidenced by enterprise software companies such as Oracle and SAP building generic systems that are adopted across industries. We will be calling this Aragon suite of project and human-coordination tools Open Enterprise, as DAOs that are solving mega-projects are the definition of an open enterprise. In building Open Enterprise, we plan to also work as consultants for other decentralized organizations that intend to become (or currently are) DAOs to build custom implementations, and also determine common requirements, so we can drive the suite toward meeting the 80% use case. The Open Enterprise roadmap will be a continuation of the Planning Suite, with an additional focus of assessing the existing Aragon App ecosystem as a whole to develop common design patterns and components for the optimal cross-application user experience.

Third parties and central authorities both inside and outside of communities have persistently tried to force their way into the relationships between members of communities. Banks, charismatic leaders, governments\u2026 all have made enticing offers and promises of security to protect the community\u2019s interests. And all have at one time or another broken these promises and violated trust. With the advent of bitcoin we were given a way to disintermediate trusted third parties and eliminate the need for central control of digital money. Now with platforms like ethereum we are seeing the rise of a new kind of organization free of centralized control: the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO for short. Communities used to have to trust a bank to protect their shared assets, leaders to govern those assets, and governments to resolve disputes and enforce judgments. DAOs now make it possible for a community to have direct control of their shared assets using smart contracts enforced by a decentralized network of computers. No central authorities required. Let\u2019s look at how this works in practice. First, a member of the community will create a DAO representing the community. They will use an app to easily translate the governance rules of the community into computer code and deploy the code onto a smart contract network like ethereum. Next, the creator of the DAO will add the members of their community to the DAO. Each member now holds a token (or tokens) representing their stake in the community. With power in the organization now held in the hands of the community members, the shared assets of the community can be transferred to the DAO and governed by the rules set by the community. Whenever the assets of the community need to be transferred, for example to pay employees or fund a community project, community members can use their tokens to vote directly to approve or decline the transfer and the outcome of the vote is executed exactly as the rules of the DAO specify. If the community chooses to delegate their power to a smaller group of administrators, they can vote to upgrade the governance rules of their DAO and give the admins the limited power they need to carry out day to day activities on behalf of community members. Then if the community decides to withdraw power from the admins for any reason, they can vote again to withdraw that power. The members are always in full control of their community. If there is a dispute between the members of a DAO or between the DAO and outside individuals or organizations, smart contracts can once again be used to resolve the disputes and execute judgment. An arbitration clause can be added to each contract that enables all parties to the contract to create a dispute that is resolved by an agreed upon arbitrator or decentralized court. And collateral can be used to limit losses by injured parties to a dispute. To some this might sound like science fiction. And to some degree, today it still is. At Aragon we are working to make this sci-fi vision a reality. We want to empower communities to take control of their destiny and break free of central authorities. And we want to provide a safe mechanism for resolving disputes outside the inflexible legal systems run by monopoly jurisdictions in the physical world. A golden age of decentralized organizations and voluntary communities is upon us.

The use of ANJ in Aragon Court helps align the incentives of jurors with the long-term health of the Court, ensuring the Court's integrity.

You can learn more about ANJ and how it is used in Aragon Court here . Initial token distribution ANJ was initially made available for pre-activation prior to the launch of Aragon Court. Anyone could stake ANT to participate in the pre-activation period, at a rate of 100 ANJ per 1 ANT, with a minimum pre-activation requirement of 10,000 ANJ. The total amount of ANT participating in the ANJ pre-activation period was 1,014,908.261129677609748657 ANT , for a total of 101,490,826.1129677609748657 ANJ pre-activated by 247 unique Ethereum addresses. The ANJ pre-activation smart contract was audited by ConsenSys Diligence, who published their audit report in November 2019. Sources: - Juror pre-activation guide - ANJ pre-activation contract - Launching Aragon Court blog post Variable supply The ANJ bonding curve went live with the official launch of Aragon Court on Fight For Freedom Day February 10, 2020. After the bonding curve went live, ANJ became available for conversion against the curve at a variable rate as determined by the bonding curve formula . From the ANJ article at the Aragon Help Desk: ANT is the reserve token used to back the ANJ supply. As more ANT is deposited in the ANJ bonding curve, the total supply of ANJ increases; as ANT is withdrawn from the bonding curve, the total supply of ANJ decreases. The bonding curve is used to convert ANT into ANJ and back at pre-defined rates. The way the ANJ bonding curve is set up, the more ANT is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer new ANJ will be released back to the sender; the more ANJ is sent to the bonding curve, the fewer ANT will be released back to the sender. The reason for using ANT as the reserve token backing ANJ is to create an economic relationship between Aragon Court and the Aragon Network. The more entities there are subscribed to Aragon Court, the more demand there should be to become a juror to service the increase in subscribers, which will in turn stoke demand for ANJ and, by proxy, ANT. The reason then for using a bonding curve to establish the economic relationship between Aragon Court and the Aragon Network, rather than create a 1:1 link or simply use ANT as the native token of the Court, is to isolate incentives between the Network and the Court. As Aragon One Researcher Luke Duncan wrote in his \" ANT Demand Modeling Framework \" post: [T]he basic framework of linking a.. token to ANT via a bonding curve... enables the services to be designed with independent protocol incentives, such as participation rate targetting. Maintaining this separation allows for more effective protocol design and reduces the complexity and risk for the average ANT holder. Total supply The current total supply of ANJ can be found by checking the ANJ contract page on a block explorer that shows this information, such as Etherscan . Maximum supply There is no maximum ANJ supply per se , other than the limit imposed by the total amount of ANT available to deposit in the ANJ bonding curve. To calculate the theoretical maximum supply, we can follow this method: ANJ comes from a bonding curve that mints ANJ in exchange for ANT. This is the only way to mint ANJ. The ANJ bonding curve is of the type: In our case the value of n is 4, taking into account that the reserve ratio equals 1/100 . To get m , we use the price set by the bonding curve when the bonding curve went live, which was the same as the pre-activation price i.e., 100 ANJ per 1 ANT, and the total amount of ANJ minted during pre-activation, 101,490,826.112967760974865700 ANJ . So: If we take the integral of that curve between two ANJ supply points, x_0 and x_1 , we get the total amount of ANT contributed to mint x_1 - x_0 ANJ tokens. So if all the existing ANT, let's call it T , were to be contributed to the curve, that amount would be the integral between 0 and the maximum possible amount of ANJ, let's call it J : Now we substitute T with the current total supply of ANT, 39,609,523.80952380954 : Therefore, given a total supply of 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT , the theoretical maximum supply of ANJ is 350,868,849.187414177 ANJ . To try calculating the ANJ supply with other amounts of ANT deposited in the bonding curve, replace T in this formula with the desired ANT amount: Automated market making The ANJ bonding curve formula not only determines the supply of ANJ, but also its conversion rate against ANT. On January 17, 2020, Aragon One Solidity Engineer Bingen Eguzkitza published an Observable document showing what the conversion rate of ANT:ANJ would be given a specified set of inputs, namely the pre-activation supply of ANJ plus or minus the amount of ANT deposited in or withdrawn from the ANJ bonding curve after the bonding curve went live. The bonding curve formula contract can be polled directly to find the current conversion rate, using the calculatePurchaseReturn option to find the ANT-to-ANJ rate and the calculateSaleReturn option to find the ANJ-to-ANT rate. There is also a conversion tool available on the Aragon website that values can be entered into to easily find the current ANT:ANJ conversion rate. Technical details ANJ is an ERC-20 token, supporting division up to 18 decimal places (i.e. 0.000000000000000001 ANJ is the smallest possible unit of ANJ).

More information about the use of ANT and ANJ in Aragon Court can be found in the Aragon Network whitepaper . Aragon Chain In a blog post announcing Aragon Chain , a Proof-of-Stake blockchain built for the Aragon community, the Aragon One team has proposed that ANT could be deposited into a bonding curve to mint Aragon Chain (ARA) tokens. These tokens would be required to stake and become a validator for the Aragon Chain. With AGP-106 approved in Aragon Network Vote #4, the blockchain development company ChainSafe is now the team responsible for putting the Aragon Chain plan into action. ChainSafe published the first public specification of Aragon Chain on January 17, 2020. Initial token distribution ANT was initially created and distributed as a result of a public token sale that took place on May 17, 2017 - starting at Ethereum block 3,723,000 to be exact. Less than 100 blocks later, 275,000 ETH worth of ANT were sold. Added together with ANT sold in the pre-sale, ANT granted to the Aragon Foundation/Association, and ANT granted to founders and early contributors, the total initial supply of ANT after the token sale is 39,609,523.80952380954 ANT.

From then on, ANT holders will use Aragon Network governance to decide the ANT issuance policy and inflation rate going forward. Sources: Etherscan Pre-sale script Technical details ANT is an ERC-20 token using the MiniMe standard . As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo wrote on the Aragon blog: We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The MiniMe Token is an ERC20 token created by the Giveth team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there). In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, we\u2019re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations. The Ethereum smart contract address of ANT is 0x960b236A07cf122663c4303350609A66A7B288C0 . Sources: Token sale audit results ANT asset analysis On October 22, 2019, Aragon One Researcher Luke Duncan published an analysis of ANT entitled \" ANT Demand Modeling Framework \". Duncan described the document as \"a basic framework for thinking about the demand for the Aragon Network Token (ANT) based on its current and potential future utility value\".

As Aragon co-founder Jorge Izquierdo wrote on the Aragon blog: We decided to use MiniMe as the base token for ANT because it offers flexibility, security, and a clear upgrade path. The MiniMe Token is an ERC20 token created by the Giveth team that maintains a history of balances and is easily cloned to create independent tokens with unique functionality (shout out to the Giveth team, definitely one of the best Solidity development teams out there). In addition, MiniMe is a great token standard for governance because it keeps track of balances at the time of starting a proposal vote. This removes the need to lock balances after voting to prevent double voting. With all of its benefits, we\u2019re considering making MiniMe the default token for all Aragon organizations.

Originally defined in AGP-1: The Aragon Governance Proposal Process , and grounded in the values of AGP-0: The Aragon Manifesto , the AGP process defines a way for community members to present proposals that introduce some change to an important area of the project, and then vote together to approve or reject the proposals. You can learn more about the AGP process on the Aragon Governance page of the wiki. Voting methods During each Aragon Network Vote, Aragon Network Token ( ANT ) holders have an opportunity to cast their votes to approve or reject proposals that have made it through the AGP process and onto the final ballot. ANT is a token on the Ethereum network, with access controlled by a private key corresponding to the owner of each token. Votes are cast by using the private key of an account holding ANT to sign a transaction authorizing a vote to be cast with the ANT. No ANT is transferred by this vote transaction, and voting can be done with keys kept completely offline in so-called \"cold storage\". Note The exact details of which AGP voting app to use and what data to use for raw transactions is published in a \"Final details\" blog post before each Aragon Network Vote. Visit the Aragon project blog to find the most recent \"Final details\" blog post with specific information about the vote you want to participate in, then cast your vote for each proposal you want to vote on. Note If you store your ANT on an exchange, then unless the exchange has explicitly enabled functionality to vote from your exchange account, you must first withdraw your ANT to an Ethereum account that you control the private key to or have the authority to vote from before the vote starts so that you can properly sign the vote transaction. After the vote has started, you can transfer the ANT back to the exchange account. These are the methods currently available to cast a vote: See section 2.2.3.3 of the Aragon User Guide for general instructions on voting using the Aragon app. Voting with keys stored in a Web3 mobile browser wallet Since the release of Aragon 0.6.3, the Aragon web client has been designed to be fully responsive. This means it is possible to create and participate in Aragon organizations using one of the growing number of Web3-compatible mobile browsers. To participate in an Aragon Network Vote from your mobile device, make sure that your Ethereum account in your Web3 mobile browser is holding ANT at the time an Aragon Network Vote starts. Then you can navigate to the AGP voting app in your Web3 mobile browser, click on the proposal you want to vote on, click the voting option you support, then sign and broadcast your vote transaction. Do this for each proposal you want to vote on to finish casting your votes. Voting with keys stored in MetaMask When voting using the Aragon app with MetaMask as the wallet and Ethereum provider, MetaMask should show you the VOTE function identifier right on top of the 0 ETH amount: You can also watch a video example here . Voting with keys stored in a Ledger hardware wallet Currently the only way to vote with a Ledger wallet is by using Frame or MetaMask as the Ethereum provider. The instructions are much the same as the above instructions for \u201cVoting with keys stored in MetaMask\u201d except that the final signing step will be performed by confirming the transaction on your Ledger wallet. See the instructions MetaMask has published for using Ledger with MetaMask here . To vote with Frame, first install the Frame desktop app from https://frame.sh and select \"Mainnet\" in the connection settings as the network you want to use. If you are using the Aragon Desktop client, that is all you need. If you are using the Aragon web client with a web browser, then you need to install a compatible Frame browser extension, links to which can also be found on https://frame.sh . Next, plug in your hardware wallet, enter your PIN, and open the Ethereum app. Navigate to the AGP voting app in Aragon, then open Frame and give the Aragon client permission to access your Ethereum accounts via Frame. Now you can vote and confirm the transaction on your Ledger hardware wallet via the Frame interface. Voting with keys stored in a Trezor hardware wallet Currently the only way to vote with a Trezor wallet is by using Frame or MetaMask as the Ethereum provider. The instructions are much the same as the above instructions for \u201cVoting with keys stored in MetaMask\u201d except that the final signing step will be performed by confirming the transaction on your Trezor wallet.

For example, proposals in the AGP Voting apps are linked to proposals on GitHub using the cryptographic hash of the final proposal (a process called \"hashing\"), and Aragon Association (AA) board members cryptographically sign their votes approving or rejecting proposals using the keypair linked to their Keybase accounts (a process called \"signing\"). This guide will show the reader how to use these tools to verify information presented to them throughout the AGP process. Note that this guide was written for Linux users but can be adapted with similar tools for other operating systems. Cryptographic hashes About cryptographic hashes A cryptographic hash function is a one-way mathematical function that can be performed on any piece of text (or \"pre-image\") to produce a compressed string of data often referred to as a \"hash\" or \"fingerprint\". For example, the hash of the word \"hash\", using the cryptographic hash function SHA-256, is d04b98f48e8f8bcc15c6ae5ac050801cd6dcfd428fb5f9e65c4e16e7807340fa and always will be. However if even one letter is changed, then the hash will be completely different. For example, the SHA-256 hash of the word \"sash\" is 2ffb6e3b73cce5c2327d349550a72e7ac6877e7aaff8e7c33e7fb386f884adef . Like a fingerprint, hashes are intended to be nearly unique, so that only a specific pre-image can produce a specific hash. * Also like a fingerprint, hashes are \"one-way\", meaning that just as you can use a finger to produce a fingerprint but you cannot use a fingerprint to re-produce the whole finger, you can use a pre-image to produce a hash but you cannot use a hash to re-produce the pre-image. The hash function only works one way . These qualities make hashes uniquely suitable for information security applications, for example to guarantee that a piece of text hasn't changed over time, or to prove that it has changed by showing that the hash of the original text does not match the hash of the modified text. Hashes can also be used to compress data in a way that can be matched with the original text later. The primary way that the Aragon community uses hashes in its governance process is to ensure that the text of the proposal that is being voted on by ANT holders matches the text of the proposal approved by AA board members. This prevents a proposal from being modified in such a way that would violate the original intent of the proposal, or at least to enable anyone to notice if the proposal has been modified and to sound the alarm. * Hashes are only \"nearly\" unique because it is theoretically possible for two different pre-images to produce the same hash. This is referred to as a \"collision\". However, for the most secure hashing algorithms available, this is basically impossible with current state of the art computers. Example: Verifying the AGP-1 proposal On November 12, 2018, the AA board members submitted their votes approving AGP-1 for a final vote by ANT holders. You can see the AA board members' votes here on GitHub: https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/tree/master/signatures/AGP-1 As mentioned above, the votes are signed. We will review how to verify the signature in the next section. Here we will verify the hash of the proposal that was approved by the board members. In this vote by board member Jorge Izquierdo, the hash of the proposal is mentioned: I hereby confirm that, as a Board Member of the Aragon Association, agree to proposing AGP-1 (with hash 4f0e9d7782fa5c1ca82ada0aba7b80cd64ba372859c5052216fe65daa1b81479) to be voted under an Aragon Network vote starting Thursday, November 15 th at 00:00 UTC, and lasting for 48 hours Here the SHA-256 hash of AGP-1 is said to be 4f0e9d7782fa5c1ca82ada0aba7b80cd64ba372859c5052216fe65daa1b81479 . We then go to the AGP Voting app where ANT holders vote on Meta track proposals: https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0xcfee4d3078f74197ce77120dbfe6d35f443cab1c Vote #0 says: Should the Aragon project adopt AGP-1 as the Aragon Governance Proposal process? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aragon/AGPs/8c945258fc58c842752a49946514815a4fdd971d/AGPs/AGP-1.md To get the hash of the AGP-1 proposal being voted on we only have to enter two commands in our terminal: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aragon/AGPs/8c945258fc58c842752a49946514815a4fdd971d/AGPs/AGP-1.md sha256sum AGP-1.md To result is returned: 4f0e9d7782fa5c1ca82ada0aba7b80cd64ba372859c5052216fe65daa1b81479 AGP-1.md This matches the hash that was signed and approved by Jorge, providing a strong, cryptogrographic link between the proposal he voted to approve and the proposal linked in the AGP Voting app. Cryptographic signatures About cryptographic signatures Cryptographic signatures (also called \"digital signatures\") are a special kind of signature used to prove that a piece of data is associated with a specific cryptographic key. By associating the public half of a public-private key pair with a specific person you can then associate data signed with the private half of the key pair with that same person. For example, if Alice tells you that her public key is 0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B , and she sends you a signed message that can be matched to that key using the proper tool, then you can be reasonably certain that Alice actually signed the message. The Aragon community uses digital signatures as part of its governance process to verify statements made by other community members. In some situations, it's good enough to just see that a specific account posted a comment in a forum. But in other situations, a stronger assurance is necessary that the message is actually coming from the intended sender and not an impersonator. In these cases, digital signatures can be used to prove that a message came from a specific sender. Example: Verifying the Aragon Association board vote on AGP-1 Continuing from the example in the section above about cryptographic hashes, we will return to the vote submitted by board member Jorge Izquierdo. Keep in mind that the techniques here work for anyone, we are just using Jorge as an example. Here is the full text of the vote, including the signature: -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA256 I hereby confirm that, as a Board Member of the Aragon Association, agree to proposing AGP-1 (with hash 4f0e9d7782fa5c1ca82ada0aba7b80cd64ba372859c5052216fe65daa1b81479) to be voted under an Aragon Network vote starting Thursday, November 15th at 00:00 UTC, and lasting for 48 hours -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- wsFcBAEBCAAQBQJb6dl7CRC21ROWS5xitwAAPU8QABeNotnqOmodW9HP0gg2yZ/k Nkn0R/W2NGA+T8GqWrkvDba/WanaMZ4AOghDnetSJw4y9LKfFtrXExIw3ZYuaShy na37QbZvQ6251zyRcWZOmNoEeRN24IcsQYOdutoHCRpzPRRzF1giMFvXxiVjJkx1 JHhOakCkc8wqbLL8IuyCY2dYCIt9GMRcrdI2qHeIUdu4DnMsRhrhd8AfFuxc53/I lALEScKg33qXZf8oDNpPQRhjFd72/BPl9ihENCYA1DZwgDJceEeqG8kndxLj4VZg 4jX0ehSfdIxNHOU+wg1h7EOACOYSQFPp4MriqQFBX2aKisNZ/XMltn1ACrU4OR8s zjBowjiQv6dq7lmvHKvqnpb7AZZh5RIyQcdsSYeRmZM8eOSxE+K+yunNW+LJJ2JQ lqN74F9Z0roNPUv6Pz2adYlqTAQ5Tact40Fb6kYlNu2Ppv0HhKDm0GqQvBUeM8/4 JjRxsyKwZCmtlqpeNg9PNTGYS2vpFsRQkydlZ7Shlm6MgbFHvroDq8ILlUcRAYax j/Xamc+EqWcAH5/4cLkFepe4oOYfBGD7Ku5Citg4QxmNllTpPsQvJKN3JHsst9Py u7X4uk16VqeQUbL6zoc3Vp+HelPf79261XQ9Mh04eGYXNmenuvwnI/Ja2ImAFw7Q nZzAdr05O2SPqomEiFVX =uQOa -----END PGP SIGNATURE----- You can see the beginning of the message at the top, the message that's being signed in the middle, and the signature at the bottom. This signature can be verified using any program that implements the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) protocol, such as the Keybase and GPG programs mentioned earlier. To verify this signature with Keybase, go to https://keybase.io/verify , paste in the full signed message, and click verify. You'll see that Keybase shows a valid signature from the key owned by user @ji , and you'll see that the user @ji has verified social media accounts including on Twitter, GitHub, Reddit, Hacker News, and even his own personal domain. Using this collection of verifications, if you know that AA board member Jorge Izquierdo also uses these verified social media profiles and websites, then you can also be reasonably certain that the signature on the vote message was actually produced by him. This is one of the strongest assurances of digital identity available today. If you prefer to verify the signature yourself rather than use Keybase's hosted tool, then you can download Jorge's public key and add it to your GPG keyring by entering: curl https://keybase.io/ji/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import Then copy the signed message, paste it into a text document, and save it as a .txt file on your computer, for example calling the file jorge_vote.txt . Then run the command: gpg --verify jorge_vote.txt The result will be a message that says: gpg: Signature made Mon 12 Nov 2018 11:50:19 AM PST using RSA key ID 4B9C62B7 gpg: Good signature from \"Aragon Security <security@aragon.org>\" gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! gpg: There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner. Primary key fingerprint: 1A94 EED3 BDDE 885A 671D F10D B6D5 1396 4B9C 62B7 Since the result says \"good signature\", it means that the message was signed by Jorge's key that you just added to your keyring. (In this case, the \"WARNING\" message can be ignored since all it is telling us is that we have not yet set a trust level for Jorge's key. This is an advanced use of GPG that we won't go into here.)","title":"How to verify cryptographic hashes and signatures"},{"location":"network/governance/verify_crypto/#how-to-verify-cryptographic-hashes-and-signatures","text":"","title":"How to verify cryptographic hashes and signatures"},{"location":"network/governance/verify_crypto/#background","text":"The Aragon community makes use of popular cryptography tools - such as Keybase and Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) - to ensure the security and integrity of the Aragon Governance Proposal (AGP) process.

Phasellus posuere in sem ut cursus. Nullam sit amet tincidunt ipsum, sit amet elementum turpis. Etiam ipsum quam, mattis in purus vitae, lacinia fermentum enim. Footnotes Usage The markup for footnotes is similar to the standard Markdown markup for links. A reference is inserted in the text, which can then be defined at any point in the document. Inserting the reference The footnote reference is enclosed in square brackets and starts with a caret, followed by an arbitrary label which may contain numeric identifiers [1, 2, 3, ...] or names [Granovetter et al. 1998]. The rendered references are always consecutive superscripted numbers. Example: Lorem ipsum[^1] dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.[^2] Result: Lorem ipsum 1 dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. 2 Inserting the content The footnote content is also declared with a label, which must match the label used for the footnote reference. It can be inserted at an arbitrary position in the document and is always rendered at the bottom of the page. Furthermore, a backlink is automatically added to the footnote reference. on a single line Short statements can be written on the same line. Example: [^1]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page on multiple lines Paragraphs should be written on the next line. As with all Markdown blocks, the content must be indented by four spaces. Example: [^2]: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla et euismod nulla. Curabitur feugiat, tortor non consequat finibus, justo purus auctor massa, nec semper lorem quam in massa. Result: Jump to footnote at the bottom of the page Equations Blocks Blocks are enclosed in $$...$$ which are placed on separate lines. $$ \\frac {n ! }{k !( n - k )! } = \\binom {n}{k} $$ Result \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \\binom{n}{k} Inline Inline equations need to be enclosed in $ ... $ : Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: $ p ( x|y ) = \\frac {p ( y|x ) p ( x ) }{p ( y ) } $ Result Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet: p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} p(x|y) = \\frac{p(y|x)p(x)}{p(y)} Tasklists Tasklists are useful for keeping track of tasks and showing what has been done and has yet to be done. Checkbox lists are like regular lists, but prefixed with [ ] for empty or [x] for filled checkboxes. Example: - [x] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit - [x] Nulla lobortis egestas semper - [ ] Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt - [x] In hac habitasse platea dictumst - [x] In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus - [ ] Praesent sed risus massa - [ ] Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque - [ ] Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Result: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit Nulla lobortis egestas semper Vestibulum convallis sit amet nisi a tincidunt In hac habitasse platea dictumst In scelerisque nibh non dolor mollis congue sed et metus Praesent sed risus massa Aenean pretium efficitur erat, donec pharetra, ligula non scelerisque Nulla vel eros venenatis, imperdiet enim id, faucibus nisi Code Highlighting Using Markdown syntaxes, code blocks can be opened and closed by writing three backticks on separate lines. To add code highlighting to those blocks, the easiest way is to specify the language directly after the opening block. Examples: ``` python import tensorflow as tf ``` ``` javascript import Messenger, { providers } from '@aragon/messenger' import { defer } from 'rxjs/observable/defer' import { empty } from 'rxjs/observable/empty' import { fromPromise } from 'rxjs/observable/fromPromise' import { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge' export const AppProxyHandler = { get (target, name, receiver) { if (name in target) { return target[name] } return function (...params) { return target.rpc.sendAndObserveResponse( 'intent', [name, ...params] ).pluck('result') } } } ``` Results: import tensorflow as tf import Messenger , { providers } from '@aragon/messenger' import { defer } from 'rxjs/observable/defer' import { empty } from 'rxjs/observable/empty' import { fromPromise } from 'rxjs/observable/fromPromise' import { merge } from 'rxjs/observable/merge' export const AppProxyHandler = { get ( target , name , receiver ) { if ( name in target ) { return target [ name ] } return function (... params ) { return target . rpc . sendAndObserveResponse ( 'intent' , [ name , ... params ] ). pluck ( 'result' ) } } } Supported languages The Code Highlighting uses Pygments , a generic syntax highlighter. It supports over 300 languages . Grouping code blocks You can use grouping for code blocks with tabs. Example: ``` bash tab=\"Bash\" #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" ``` ``` c tab=\"C\" #include <stdio.h> int main(void) { printf(\"Hello world!\\n\"); } ``` ``` c++ tab=\"C++\" #include <iostream> int main() { std::cout << \"Hello world!\" << std::endl; return 0; } ``` Result: Bash #!/bin/bash echo \"Hello world!\" C #include <stdio.h> int main ( void ) { printf ( \"Hello world! \\n \" ); } C++ #include <iostream> int main () { std :: cout << \"Hello world!\" << std :: endl ; return 0 ; } Highlighting specific lines Specific lines can be highlighted by passing the line numbers to the hl_lines argument placed right after the language identifier. Line counts start at 1. Example: ``` python hl_lines=\"3 4\" \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort(items): for i in range(len(items)): for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i): if items[j] > items[j + 1]: items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j] ``` Result: 1 2 3 4 5 6 \"\"\" Bubble sort \"\"\" def bubble_sort ( items ): for i in range ( len ( items )): for j in range ( len ( items ) - 1 - i ): if items [ j ] > items [ j + 1 ]: items [ j ], items [ j + 1 ] = items [ j + 1 ], items [ j ] Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. \u21a9 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Aragon Working Groups were first brought up by John Light and detailed here . The purpose of this documentation is to: Officialize Aragon Working Groups as a collaboration tool in the Aragon community Provide guidelines on how to officialize an Aragon Working Group Context The Aragon Network DAO, encompassing the Aragon community, Nest, and Flock, has been expanding quickly. Specifically, the Flock program went from one to three teams in only six months and the number of active contributors to Aragon has been increasing. As a result, cooperation around different key matters has been emerging organically across teams, in chat rooms and on the Aragon forum. Working Groups are a way to formalize collaborative initiatives in order to make them accessible and visible to all, ultimately making it easier to collaborate across the ecosystem. Formalizing an Aragon Working Group The formalization of Working Groups consists in making public their existence and bylaws. A Working Group registry with key information on each Working Group is available here . The purpose of this registry is to legitimize a given Working Group and give it more visibility to all Aragon contributors. Definition of an Aragon Working group Below are elements one may want to consider when creating an Aragon Working Group. Foundations Purpose - What is the working group about? Membership - How to join? Structure and operation suggestions The following are suggestions for your Aragon Working Group structure: Calls - weekly or biweekly call with notes publicly published in the dedicated WG Wiki section Facilitators - Choose 2 facilitators who are rotating every week/ couple of weeks/meeting cycle. Facilitators are in charge of preparing the agenda for the call, asking people to take notes, and publishing the notes. They are also in charge of moderating the Working group chat. Decision making can be fluid, participatory, a do-ocracy like model Working groups can collaborate using focused discussion channels on Spectrum as well as a Github repository. Working groups can also adopt tags in the Aragon Forum to categorize threads around their specific projects. Working groups with multiple projects can have sub-groups with a subset of its members that are collaborating on more specific projects. These sub-groups can have their own processes for joining and participating, which should also be documented in the Working Group\u2019s Aragon Wiki section. Tooling suggestions Aragon organization - votes/surveys, membership, funds, project/bounties management. Forum - Formalized working groups can be attributed a sub-section on the Aragon forum to have threads related to work in WGs. Chat channels - WGs can have a dedicated chat room on Spectrum. If necessary it can be subdivided in teams. GitHub repository to organize work. We are also proposing to adopt Taiga as a public task management tool for the Working Groups to coordinate and organize their work. Anyone can create and join a working group.

The previous logic updated the UI, so Daniel's solution for now is that the logic has a statusCallback handler that can the interface can use to update. We discussed better ways to do this, like the lib emitting events, but we agreed that this is an improvement to the lib that we could do later. Daniel also created a unit test for this isolated logic. We all agreed that any future logic extractions should be accompanied with new unit tests. We discussed end to end tests and agreed that we will not worry abou them for now - just run manual commands related to what is being refactored and try to make sure nothing broke. End to end tests will be re-addressed once this refactor matures, and will probably involve their own refactor. We discussed introducing Typescript while we do the refactor but agreed to NOT do this now but later, once we have a good percentage of the logic extracted from the interface. Next steps: Ale and Mathew finish merging outstanding PRs. Gabi finishes setting up the development branch and branching strategy. Daniel rebases this refactor proposal to the latest state of master. Ale creates an issue with the plan for implementing this refactor to the entire codebase - it will have a list of commands to refactor, which can be addressed simultaneously by multiple people and each refactored command is a separate PR to the develop branch. We all start picking off commands from this list and implement the refactor in parallel.
