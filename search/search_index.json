We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives.\n\n\nBy making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value.\n\n\nGOODBYE UNNECESSARY INTERMEDIARIES\n\n\n\nReclaim your independence\n\n\n\n\nAragon organizations are powered by Ethereum, a global blockchain for running unstoppable applications. In Ethereum, code and applications always run without any possibility of downtime or censorship.\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain technology provides a single shared source of cryptographically verified truth. This is secured by a network made up of thousands of computers all over the globe. Anyone can set up their own node where all the necessary data is replicated across the network.\n\n\nThis decentralized design ensures a borderless and permissionless way of operating, without the fear of a government or a malicious third-party interfering.\n\n\nIMAGINE A NATION WITHOUT LAND AND BORDERS\n\n\n\nA digital jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isn\u2019t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country.\n\n\n\n\nAragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues.\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future.\n\n\nAragon Core\n\n\nDecentralized application to run your organization\n\n\n\nTRANSFER TOKENS\n\n\n\nTokens represent your stake in the organization\n\n\nYour organization is in control of its funds. Transfer and assign them according to your personal needs without artificial limitations.\n\n\nFUNDRAISING\n\n\n\nGrasp the potential of a new form of crowdfunding\n\n\nUtilize the power of the crowd for funding and raise funds globally, in private or publicly, without relying on banks or financial gatekeepers.\n\n\nVOTING\n\n\n\nDecision-making by voting\n\n\nUse voting for more effective results. Votes are a secure, transparent and unforgeable way to come to a decision on major issues.\n\n\nPAYMENTS\n\n\n\nInstant payments in a few clicks\n\n\nAdding a new employee to your organization and payroll is as easy as creating a new recurring payment.\n\n\nACCOUNTING\n\n\n\nTamper-proof, effective accounting\n\n\n\n\nEvery transaction is recorded and can be verified on the blockchain at any given time\n\n\n\n\nUnprecedented level of transparency can be gained through the use of a public blockchain to engrave every entry permanently on the ledger.\n\n\nPre-established rules can automatically define your quarterly spending and budgeting.\n\n\nPERMISSIONS\n\n\n\nFlexible and resilient privilege escalation\n\n\n\n\nFine-grained permissions deliver the freedom to create an organization that will work for you.\n\n\n\n\nPermissions can be granular and assigned in fine detail. You can choose to give people a certain degree of control over the organization and privileges can be escalated easily through a voting or different mechanisms if the person isn't allowed to directly perform a desired action.\n\n\nBy assigning different permissions to people, you can create the kind of organizational structure that is best suited for your needs.\n\n\nAragon Network\n\n\nEnsuring the success of decentralized organizations\n\n\n\nPutting the power back into the hands of the users\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network will establish additional services for the organizations taking advantage of what Aragon Core provides.\n\n\nOur mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity.\n\n\nARAGON GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS\n\n\n\nJoin us in improving Aragon by making your voice heard\n\n\nAragon Governance Proposals\n is a system for community members to join the discussion and create proposals affecting Aragon.\n\n\nEveryone is welcome to \njoin in and aid\n in forging the future of how Aragon will shape out to be. Together we can build the exciting future we want to see.\n\n\nWhy Aragon?\n\n\n\n\nAragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization. We want to give the users the freedom they deserve to run their lives.\n\n\n\n\nOrganizations like companies exist to create value for their owners and users. They use the resources available to them in order to provide services and to create products.\n\n\nTheir ability to do this efficiently is hindered by factors outside of their influence. By removing unnecessary intermediaries and third parties that impose artificial restrictions and unnecessarily complex regulations, we can modernize the way organizations are run.\n\n\nOUR VISION\n\n\n\nEvolution of the internet and blockchain technology are changing the ways we interact with each other\n\n\nWe believe that the progression of modern technology solutions, such as the invention of the blockchain, are changing the incentives for people to interact with each other. We are building the tools for the next generation of organizations to take advantage of this revolution.\n\n\nExperimenting with new governance models has been a very risky endeavour during previous iterations of society. Now, for the first time in human history, we can let a thousand new governance models emerge, all from the comfort of our laptops.\n\n\nCommunity channels\n\n\nAragon Chat - \nhttps://aragon.chat\n\n\nReddit - \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject/\n\n\nTwitter - \nhttps://twitter.com/aragonproject\n\n\nLinkedIn - \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/aragonproject/\n\n\nYouTube - \nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/AragonProject\n\n\nTeams\n\n\n\n\nTo encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Foundation to form a company of core developers.

The company is currently established in Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as possible.\n\n\nFunding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to future teams that will be working on the project as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO / Chief Executive Officer\n: \nLuis Cuende\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuis has been awarded as the best underage European programmer in 2011, is a \nForbes 30 Under 30\n, a \nMIT TR35\n and was an Advisor to the VP of the European Commission.\n\n\nHe cofounded the blockchain startup \nStampery\n.

Featured all the basic functionality that an organization needs to operate. It was not made public.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Alpha\n: February 2017\n\n\nRelease link\n\n\n\n\n0.2 \u2014 The Public Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was the first public release. Working in both macOS, Linux and Windows. Introduced a new UI styling and Kovan testnet support.\n\n\nFor more information, read \nthe launch post\n.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: February 2017\n\n\nRelease link\n\n\n\n\n0.3 \u2014 The Governance Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis version added the Bring your own token functionality, that allows using Aragon with any ERC20 token as a governance token\u2014ERC20 is a token standard allows everyone to interface with a variety of tokens in a common way. It also added two new bylaws, specific address only and ask oracle contract for confirmation\u2014stepping stone for more dynamic bylaws.\n\n\nIt introduced delegate voting and creation of custom, complex stock classes.\n\n\nIt featured new iconography, notable startup time improvements and web browser support for using it with Ethereum browsers/clients like Mist, Parity, MetaMask, Status etc.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: April 2017\n\n\nRelease link\n\n\n\n\n0.4 \u2014 The Bridge Release\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nEconomic abstraction\n\n\nCompanies will be able to hold and interact with any standard value-holding token\n\n\nImproved budgeting and accounting\n\n\nOrganizations will be in itself the organization's \nbank account\n.\n\n\nDividends\n\n\nDividend sharing with shareholders, if desired.\n\n\nFundraising tokens\n\n\nCompany will be able to raise funds in the form of tokens, not necessarily ether. More flexible founding routes.\n\n\nFunds vault\n\n\nFinal funds vault API, the only part of the company that is not expected to change. This will make upgradeability easier, being able to redeploy significant parts of the organization while maintaining its access to the funds.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: July 2017\n\n\nRelease link\n: Deprecated due to refactor for Aragon 0.3\n\n\n\n\nThis will be a development version only focusing on smart contracts, iterating between different models for upgradeability, extensibility and security.\u2029\n\n\n0.5 \u2014 The Architect Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will consist of a total refactor, and will focus on adding:\n\n\nOrganization-wide identity\n\n\nEntities in organizations will be able to register their own usernames in the organization, and also provide offchain metadata for displaying purposes in the UI.\n\n\nFull upgradeability\n\n\nOrganizations that will be able to run as long as the Ethereum blockchain runs. No matter if big chunks of functionality are swapped.\n\n\nTotally new permission system\n\n\nExtensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL (Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains.\n\n\nSwitch to an exokernel architecture\n\n\nBy making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to the installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity in apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier.\n\n\nFront-end apps API\n\n\nThis will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality.\nWe will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI toolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns.\n\n\nCore apps API\n\n\nThe API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more low-level capabilities.\n\n\nDecentralized package management\n\n\nBy creating the \nAragon Package Manager\n, which is a decentralized organization built on Aragon itself, we enable the frontend and smart contracts to be seamlessly upgraded by using any governance mechanism compatible with aragonOS.\n\n\nHuman readable transactions\n\n\nThanks to our work on \nRadspec\n, the Aragon interface can show users a human readable description of the actions the users take on the app.\n\n\nSupport for templates\n\n\nTemplates allow users to bootstrap organizations with the proper permissions to replicate multiple existing models such a startup, a democracy, an open source community... with just a click.\n\n\nSurvey app on mainnet\n\n\nThe Survey app is an app built on Aragon that enables token holders to signal their support to different proposal. The first one is live on the mainnet now at \nhttps://survey.aragon.org\n.\n\n\n\n\nBlockchain projects that have already manifested interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: April 2018\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: From May 2017 to July 2018\n\n\nBeta (mainnet)\n: August 2018\n\n\nRelease link\n\n\n\n\nThis will be the first release that gets deployed to the mainnet.\nAfter months of public bug bounties in the mainnet, we will start allowing the first\norganizations to be created using Aragon in the mainnet.\n\n\n0.6 \u2014 The Sweet Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nPermissions app\n\n\nThis app will allow stakeholders to read and alter permissions on the organization, by using the modular permission system established by aragonOS.\n\n\nIdentity component\n\n\nThe identity component will replace all Ethereum addresses with easy to understand identity icons and names for user friendliness, and also serve to autocomplete entities while interacting with the app.\n\n\nStability fixes\n\n\nFix bugs and possible issues, both for users and also developers using our developer tools to create Aragon apps.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nBeta (mainnet)\n: August 2018\n\n\n\n\n0.7 \u2014 The Network Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nBasic network-wide governance\n\n\nWhich power the network will have over organizations, governance votings to decide on service providers, payouts functionality.\n\n\nApp center\n\n\nThe App center will allow third party apps to be installed in Aragon in order to enable different organizations to address different needs. Any aragonOS-compatible app will be able to be installed, and recommendations will be given to users.\n\n\nANT token minting\n\n\nThe network will be responsible for the minting policy of ANT, it will be decided through the governance of the network. Some of its responsibilities will be to decide the minting rate, the price and how companies pay for the subscription to the network.\n\n\nIntegrate upgradeability\n\n\nProvide upgradeability as a network service for all Aragon Network organizations.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: November 2018\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: December 2018\n\n\nProduction deploy (mainnet)\n: January 2019\n\n\n\n\n0.8 \u2014 The Court Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis release will focus on adding:\n\n\nAragon Jurisdiction\n\n\nProvide a decentralized court, Aragon Jurisdiction, as network service or work with a decentralized court project to make it work with the network.\n\n\nOrgs in the AN respond to ANJ\n\n\nOrganizations in the Aragon Network start being under the Aragon Jurisdiction.\n\n\nConstitution proposal\n\n\nFirst proposal for the basic laws that all organizations will be act under.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Calendar\n\n\n\n\nAlpha\n: Q1 2019\n\n\nBug bounty (mainnet)\n: Q2 2019\n\n\nProduction deploy (mainnet)\n: Q3 2019\u2029\n\n\n\n\n0.9 \u2014 The Unknown Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a wildcard release. The ecosystem is evolving very quickly and we don't know what interesting features we may want to add that will make the 1.0 release more appealing.\n\n\nSome ideas of what we might work on here:\n\n\nPrivacy-focused companies\n\n\nzkSnarks\n could provide companies with way more privacy. Private voting and ownership are very interesting concepts we are researching about.\n\n\nDifferent governance mechanisms\n\n\nWe are closely following research and experimentation on other governance mechanisms such as \nFutarchy\n.\n\n\n1.0 \u2014 The Release\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect to start marketing Aragon to the mainstream with this release. To achieve that mission, we will have to place an important focus on design and user experience.",

Totally new permission system  Extensible permission system to allow any entity to interact with another one using an ACL (Access Control List) that the kernel controls and maintains.  Switch to an exokernel architecture  By making the kernel a very simple contract that just keeps the ACL and keep references to the installed apps, we can make it more secure and reduce the lines of code and complexity in apps, since there can be multiple instances of an app, also making upgradeability easier.  Front-end apps API  This will let developers build modules for Aragon that extend its functionality.\nWe will provide an API for developers to access functionality from the Aragon client, and a UI toolkit for them to adhere to our styling and UX patterns.  Core apps API  The API will let the developer trigger actions inside the organization itself, and access more low-level capabilities.  Decentralized package management  By creating the  Aragon Package Manager , which is a decentralized organization built on Aragon itself, we enable the frontend and smart contracts to be seamlessly upgraded by using any governance mechanism compatible with aragonOS.  Human readable transactions  Thanks to our work on  Radspec , the Aragon interface can show users a human readable description of the actions the users take on the app.  Support for templates  Templates allow users to bootstrap organizations with the proper permissions to replicate multiple existing models such a startup, a democracy, an open source community... with just a click.

Actions from for-profit entities that benefit from open source without giving back should be disincentivized. The other main characteristic is the respect of user\u2019s freedom: \u201cFreedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve a program\u201d. Users, individually and collectively, should control the software and not the other way around. This is the main and broad reasoning behind our choices.\n\n\nMore specifically, when a tool offers unique capabilities and functionality we want the future generations of those tools to remain free (libre).

Actions from for-profit entities that benefit from open source without giving back should be disincentivized. The other main characteristic is the respect of user\u2019s freedom: \u201cFreedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve a program\u201d. Users, individually and collectively, should control the software and not the other way around. This is the main and broad reasoning behind our choices.  More specifically, when a tool offers unique capabilities and functionality we want the future generations of those tools to remain free (libre).

            "text": "Aragon 0.5 Audit by Adam Dossa\n\n\nThis was the initial review of the aragonOS system that powers the v0.5 release of Aragon. Further audits and public bug\nbounty programs are scheduled to begin in early January 2018.\n\n\nAll the changes triggered as result of the audit can be found in the \naragonOS\n and \naragon-apps\n repos\n\n\nThe original PDF report has been converted to Markdown for easier reading. You can download unmodified report from the auditor here:\n\n\nDownload original PDF\n\n\nThe repository \naragon-core\n has been renamed to \naragonOS\n after this audit took place and that change has been reflected in this document. See the PDF file above for the untouched original report.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis audit report was undertaken by \n@adamdossa\n for the purpose of providing feedback to Aragon.\n\nIt has been written without any express or implied warranty.\n\n\nThe review focussed on the Solidity contract code in these repos, and covered:\n\n\n\n\npossible attack vectors\n\n\nmismatches between logic and documentation\n\n\npossible code improvements\n\n\nconfusing functionality or naming\n\n\n\n\nThe review was performed using the code tagged with \naudit1\n at the following commits.\n\n\naragonOS\n:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/tree/audit1/contracts\n\n\naragon-apps\n:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/tree/audit1/apps\n\n\nWe used RocketChat to coordinate the review and help resolve questions during the review process.\n\n\nOverview\n\n\nOverall the code structure was readable, well-documented and structured coherently and consistently.\n\n\nFunctions largely conform to the best practices at:\n\n\nhttps://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/style-guide.html\n\nmaking the structure and code easy to parse and understand.\n\n\nThe codebase also included comprehensive testing suites, using the Truffle testing framework. The Aragon team also employs a coverage framework and linter process to ensure their code remains consistent and testing comprehensive.\n\n\nThe team was responsive, measured and prompt in their responses and feedback during the process.\n\n\nGeneral Comments\n\n\n\n\nThere were a few functions that were missing explicit function visibility modifiers. This has been\nreviewed and corrected (including linter updates) via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/pull/33\n\n\nIn addition to the below there are a few miscellaneous fixes and improvements that have been made, including additional testing coverage and minor fixes.

This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/145\n  \n\n\nThe use of \ndelegatecall\n to execute underlying App logic is a clever way of preserving state and Ether value in the \nDelegateProxy\n whilst using the code / business logic of an upgradable \nApp\n contract.

In the expected use-cases, where \nAppProxy\n contracts are instantiated and initialised through a factory process (within a single atomic transaction) this is not problematic, but there is\nsome potential for this structure to be abused in unexpected use-cases, allowing a malicious user to front-run \nAppProxy\n contracts. The Aragon team discussed various options internally and an approach was implemented to allow an optional \ninitializePayload\n to be passed to the \nAppProxy\n constructor, which can be used to initialise the contract as part of its instantiation.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragonOS/pull/148\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nGiven the use of \ndelegatecall\n, the documentation could clarify the intention as to whether \nApp\n contracts are designed to be used as factory contracts, or redeployed for each Aragon organisation.\n\n\nIt may be sensible to make the \n10000\n gas in \nAppProxy\n a variable that can be modified to account for any future changes to opcode gas costs for \ndelegatecall\n.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/voting/contracts\n\n\nThis contract allows votes to take place on arbitrary actions, using the MiniMeToken to determine voting power of token holders.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nThe \nVoterState\n of \nAbsent\n doesn't seem to be used anywhere - not sure if this is in for some future purpose perhaps, if not it could be removed.\n\n\nThe \nVoting\n app automatically executed a vote payload once the outcome of the vote was beyond doubt. Whilst this is useful functionality, it made it hard for a voter to estimate gas requirements and the effect of their vote transaction deterministically (as the outcome depended on whether or not the vote tipped the balance). A boolean parameter has now been introduced to allow a voter to specify whether or not they want their vote to automatically execute the vote payload (if appropriate) via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/ae8a92e05c9bb90892da24e09ba1354fe49514ac\n\n\n\n\nPossible improvements\n\n\n\n\nCurrently the duration of a vote is fixed on initialisation of the \nVoting\n contract - it may be worth considering making this a per-Vote variable instead to allow for both long and short-dated votes. Since the \n_minAcceptQuorumPct\n can be modified during the lifetime of the contract, it may be that users also want to change \nvoteTime\n as well.\n\n\nThe event \nCastVote\n should include the number of votes being cast to allow easier off-chain tracking of vote status. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/8ea8cda2d190a695d2a7ec0d7680c4c8bafd5054\n\n\nWhen modifying the \n_minAcceptQuorumPct\n through \nchangeMinAcceptQuorumPct\n it may be worth emitting an event for this change. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/03f26441f60a4dedd042749972218fb6dadaa9de\n\n\nWhen creating a new vote through the \nforward\n method, it may be worth putting a non-blank \n_metadata\n in to make it clearer to track where the vote has come from. This could incorporate the forwarding entities address.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/token-manager/contracts\n\n\nThis contract manages token actions through the MiniMeToken contract (either wrapping another token, or natively).\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\ncanForward\n allows holders of tokens which have not yet vested to forward request - this may be intentional, but worth clarifying in the documentation.\n\n\nIt is technically possible for a single \nTokenManager\n to be set as the controller for multiple \nMiniMeToken\n contracts. It may be worth asserting in the \nTokenController\n functions (\nonApprove\n, \nonTransfer\n, \nproxyPayment\n) that \nmsg.sender\n matches the expected \ntoken\n value, to avoid any\nmisconfiguration.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nThe vesting model follows broadly the Zeppelin approach. In my experience clients have often wanted a simpler model with a single cliff date, upon which all tokens vest. This is not possible to achieve with the implemented approach as the tokens must vest linearly between the start and vesting dates (with nothing vesting before the cliff date).\n\n\nIt may be worth mentioning in the documentation that it is important to set the \ncontroller\n in the \nMiniMeToken\n to be the \nTokenManager\n (i.e. that it isn't sufficient to initialise the \nTokenManager\n with the \nMiniMeToken\n but that the link needs to go both ways).\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/group/contracts\n\n\nThis contract acts as a simple way to permission a group of entities as a single entity.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nIn the documentation, there is a minor grammatical mistake - the phrase \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that the only other context the group possesses.\" should perhaps be \"This is needed for identification purposes, given that it is the only context the group possesses.\".\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/fundraising/contracts\n\n\nThis contract is responsible for raising funds (in any ERC20 token, which could include wrapped Ether) in return for a new ERC20 token.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nIn line 297, it should be \n(period.finalPrice != initialPrice)\n rather than \n(period.finalPrice != 0)\n. From the documentation, it says:\n\n\"A period has an initial and final price. If they are not the same, price for a given timestamp is linearly interpolated in function of time.\" This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/49253097831a6f979c68c309ae0c6c00c325af4d\n\n\nIn function \n_buy\n the calculation of \nreturnAmount\n is subject to rounding errors I believe. i.e. in the \nisInversePrice\n case, if dividing by \npricePrecision\n leads to rounding, then re-multiplying by \npricePrecision\n may not yield the expected value. This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems.\n\n\nThe \ninitialize\n function could check that the \nTokenManager\n is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable \n_tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0\n.\n\n\nHaving \ngetCurrentPrice\n behave differently on a \ncall\n / \nsendTransaction\n may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a \nconstant\n function instead. I agree that functionally this works as \ntransitionSalePeriodIfNeeded\n is always called before any other state modifying functions execute.\n\n\ncalculatePrice\n has an implicit dependency on \ntransitionSalePeriodIfNeeded\n being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between \nsale.periodStartTime\n and \nsale[currentPeriod].periodEnds\n. This is redundant in the current code (since \ntransitionSalePeriodIfNeeded\n is always called before \ncalculatePrice\n but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts). This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/commit/c239847065eebb2f2b3ea2dbc264b8a25cd788cd\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nAdding a token purchase function which allows a beneficiary address (rather than \nmsg.sender\n) to receive tokens may be useful.\n\n\nHaving the ability to associate a script to be called on a sale closing may be useful. This script could for example ensure that no more tokens could be minted (effectively capping the issued tokens supply) by revoking \nMINT_ROLE\n permissions from the \nTokenManager\n, or allow the \nFundRaising\n contract to transfer \nCREATE_SALES_ROLE\n permission to a different entity (i.e. a\n\nVotingApp\n associated with the token being issued).\n\n\nMaybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to \nraisedToken\n and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this \nraisedToken\n and \nissuedToken\n or similar). i.e. \nuint256 returnTokens = ...\n could become \nuint256 returnRaisedTokens = ...\n, \n_payedTokens\n could become \n_paidRaisedTokens\n, \n_value\n in \ntokenFallback\n could become \n_paidRaisedToken\n, \nsale.minBuy\n would become \nsale.minRaised\n and so on.\n\n\nI'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each \nSale\n could have a different \nraisedToken\n), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing. I can see that it may be required to have a follow-on sale, but wonder whether having each sale being represented by a new FundRaisingProxy may be simpler / clearer.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/finance/contracts\n\n\nThis contract is responsible for tracking transactions (payments or deposits) across an organisations token balances, and managing scheduled payments.\n\n\nGiven the importance of this contract and the value there would be in exploiting it, it may be worth having this specific contract be audited separately by multiple individuals and / or placing a bounty within a live deployment to encourage investigation.\n\n\nIssues\n\n\n\n\nAny reason why the minimum payment duration is 2, rather than 1:\n\n\nrequire(_periodDuration > 1);\n\nI can see that you use \nsettings.periodDuration - 1\n as the duration length, but not clear why you don't just use \nsettings.periodDuration\n (with the requirement that \nsettings.periodDuration > 0\n);\n\n\nIn both \ntokenFallback\n, and \ndeposit\n the \n_token.transferFrom\n and \ntoken.transfer\n methods could potentially re-enter the \nFinance\n app. I can't immediately see how this can cause an issue, but worth being aware of.\n\n\nIt may be worth mentioning in the documentation that payments can be \"back-dated\", in which case the receiver will be eligible to execute all \"back-dated\" payments. This has now been resolved via:\n\n\nhttps://github.com/aragon/aragon-wiki/commit/b2cde71d3faa8212a3124813901b8d5280d93c76\n\n\nIf the budget for a token is reduced during a period (via \nsetBudget\n) it is possible that \n_getRemainingBudget\n may throw if the amount already spent (\n\nperiods[currentPeriodId()].tokenStatement[_token].expenses\n) is larger than the new budget (in which case \nsettings.budgets[_token].sub(spent)\n will throw). It may be better to return 0 rather than throwing in this case.\n\n\n_makePaymentTransaction\n could record the payment reference in the corresponding transaction reference.\n\n\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nThere are no restrictions on what ERC20 tokens can be used for deposits. This would allow an attacker to create an ERC20 token which always returns \ntrue\n on \n_token.transferFrom\n without actually depositing any tokens. Whilst this isn't really an issue it would be possible to bloat the \ntransactions\n array. Not sure there is really an easy solution to this, although having an optional \"whitelist\" of allowed token addresses that can be deposited is an option.\n\n\n\n\naragon-apps/apps/vault/contracts\n\n\nThis contract is used to store an organisations tokens (and wrapped Ether). Any actual balances will be held in the corresponding \nAppProxy\n contract.\n\n\nThis is a nice and simple contract, with no obvious issues.\n\n\nPossible Improvements\n\n\n\n\nPotentially integrating this contract with the \nFinance\n contracts budget functionality. In other words setting a budget in the \nFinance\n app could require a corresponding allowance in the \nVault\n app for the given token.",

It may be worth mentioning in the documentation that it is important to set the  controller  in the  MiniMeToken  to be the  TokenManager  (i.e. that it isn't sufficient to initialise the  TokenManager  with the  MiniMeToken  but that the link needs to go both ways).",

This is an issue that is worth being aware of, but is unlikely to lead to any genuine problems.  The  initialize  function could check that the  TokenManager  is running in native (rather than wrapped) mode by checking the public variable  _tokenManager.wrappedToken == 0 .  Having  getCurrentPrice  behave differently on a  call  /  sendTransaction  may be confusing. You could refactor this so that it is genuinely a  constant  function instead. I agree that functionally this works as  transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded  is always called before any other state modifying functions execute.  calculatePrice  has an implicit dependency on  transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded  being called before it is used. This could be enforced in the function (e.g. by checking that the current timestamp is between  sale.periodStartTime  and  sale[currentPeriod].periodEnds . This is redundant in the current code (since  transitionSalePeriodIfNeeded  is always called before  calculatePrice  but would make it harder to make errors in the future, or in derived contracts).

Maybe worth making the distinction between tokens being raised, and tokens being issued clearer through consistent variable naming. Tracking which variables correspond to  raisedToken  and which correspond to tokens being issued was confusing (maybe consistently call this  raisedToken  and  issuedToken  or similar). i.e.  uint256 returnTokens = ...  could become  uint256 returnRaisedTokens = ... ,  _payedTokens  could become  _paidRaisedTokens ,  _value  in  tokenFallback  could become  _paidRaisedToken ,  sale.minBuy  would become  sale.minRaised  and so on.  I'm not sure what the motivation to have multiple (potentially concurrent) ongoing sales is? I guess if you wanted to raise from a mix of tokens that would make sense (as each  Sale  could have a different  raisedToken ), but in this case you wouldn't have a consolidated cap etc., which would make it confusing. I can see that it may be required to have a follow-on sale, but wonder whether having each sale being represented by a new FundRaisingProxy may be simpler / clearer.",

This means that in  delegatedFwd(target, msg.data) ,  target  could potentially be delegating to a malicious contract. As far as I know, exploiting this would be extremely difficult, but it should be clear in the surrounding documentation that the  kernel   MUST  be carefully set.      KernelProxy  should fail on construction if  _kernelImpl  is not a contract  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  delegatedFwd(kernelImpl, msg.data)  will always fail if  kernelImpl == 0  or is not a contract. In such a case, it would also be impossible to run  upgradeKernel() .      KernelProxy s' initialization can be front-runned:  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  initialize()  is public and accessible to anyone after the proxy is deployed. This should at least be highlighted in documentation for  Kernel.initialize()  and the  KernelProxy  so as to make sure users always create and initialize these proxies in one atomic transaction, but a better solution would be to introduce the same  initializePayload  that is in  AppProxy .      Kernel.revokePermission()  can be front-runned:  aragonOS/contracts/kernel/KernelProxy.sol :  There are many possible outcomes when  revokePermission()  races with an entity wishing to perform an action associated with the revoked role. As in all front-running cases, the entity learning of the revocation has the upper hand as he can send his transactions with much higher gas prices. I don't see any good way around this, as this is a pretty general problem plaguing all systems implementing revocable controls. It may be a good idea to note this in the comments and associated documentation. The best way around the problem is just to never give permissions to an entity you don't entirely trust, but this is obviously not very practical (yet).",

Re-entrancy shouldn't be a problem either, as all state changes happen before the call to  transfer() .    Oyente also reported a potential re-entrancy error in  MiniMeToken.sol  On analysis, this does not seem to be a real problem    Note that Oyente wasn't able to parse interface files, but even if it could, it wouldn't find any issues in them",

The controller of a MiniMeToken is an address that can mint and destroy tokens, it also gets a 'hook' call on every transfer and approval giving the controller the chance to note it and decide whether to let the transfer through.\n\n\nIts most important features are minting new tokens and locking token transferability over time (vesting).\n\n\nOne Token Manager instance can manage one MiniMe token.\n\n\nModes\n\n\nToken Manager can handle two modes or use-cases. The mode is set on initialization and cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\nNative token mode\n: The managed token can be minted arbitrarily.\n\n\nWrapped token mode\n: The managed token acts as a wrapper to another ERC20 token. The managed token can only be minted by staking (wrapping) units of the wrapped token. At any time a holder of the wrapper token can exchange it back for the original token (unless there is vesting).\n\n\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nThere are two different initializers depending on the mode.\n\n\nNative\n\n\ntokenManager.initializeNative(address token)\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\nToken\n: The token being managed. The Token Manager should have already been set as the \ncontroller\n for the token.\n\n\n\n\nWrapped\n\n\ntokenManager.initializeWrapped(address wrapperToken, address wrappedToken)\n\n\n\n\nParameters:\n\n\n\n\nWrapper token\n: Same as token above.\n\n\nWrapped token\n: Address of the token that will be wrapped\n\n\n\n\nMode specific functionality\n\n\nNative mode\n\n\nMint tokens\n\n\ntokenManager.mint(address receiver, uint256 amount)\n\n\n\n\nCreates new tokens and assigns them to the receiver.\n\n\nIssue tokens\n\n\ntokenManager.issue(uint256 amount)\n\n\n\n\nCreates new tokens that are assigned to the Token Manager. Those can be later assigned.\n\n\nWrapper mode\n\n\nWrapper mode works under the assumption that the wrapped token is a trusted ERC20 implementation, meaning transfers are performed normally (no fees on token transfers like) and balances constant if no operations are made.\n\n\nWrap tokens\n\n\ntokenManager.wrap(uint256 amount)\n\n\n\n\nRequires an existing ERC20 allowance to the Token Manager address for at least that amount of tokens. It will transfer the wrapped tokens to the Token Manager and mint an equal amount of wrapper tokens for the sender.\n\n\nWill fail if sender hasn't created the allowance or doesn't have enough wrapped token balance.\n\n\nUnwrap tokens\n\n\ntokenManager.unwrap(uint256 amount)\n\n\n\n\nIt will burn the wrapper tokens and transfer the user the same amount in wrapped tokens.\n\n\nWill fail if sender doesn't own that many tokens.\n\n\nGeneric functionality\n\n\nAssign tokens\n\n\ntokenManager.assign(address receiver, uint256 amount)\n\n\n\n\nTransfers tokens from Token Manager balance to \nreceiver\n. Token Manager can own tokens as a result of an \nissue\n operation on native mode or just because the Token Manager received a normal token transfer.\n\n\nAssign vested tokens\n\n\ntokenManager.assignVested(address receiver, uint256 amount, { Vesting parameters })\n\n\n\n\nPerforms an assign but attaches rules on when the receiver can transfer her tokens. Next section goes in depth into how vesting works.\n\n\nRevoke vesting\n\n\ntokenManager.revokeVesting(address holder, uint256 vestingId)\n\n\n\n\nRevokes a vesting from a holder (if vesting is revokable).\n\n\nVesting\n\n\nAssigning tokens with vesting performs a normal ERC20 token transfer operation but then the holder will only be able to perform transfers according to a vesting calendar.\n\n\nMiniMe tokens perform a check with their controller before doing a token transfer. This hook is used by the Token Manager to check whether a holder can transfer the desired tokens.\n\n\nBy making the holders the direct owners of the tokens, they are able to use tokens for actions that check the token balance such as voting, while at the same time being able to lock transferability of them. Vested holders are also allowed to forward transactions through the TokenManager.\n\n\nVesting parameters\n\n\n\n\nStart: timestamp in seconds that marks the beginning of the vesting schedule (can be a past or future date).\n\n\nCliff: timestamp for the first moment in which any assigned tokens can be transferred. The amount of tokens that gets unlocked in the cliff is directly proportional to the overall vesting schedule.\n\n\nVesting: timestamp for the moment all tokens assigned are transferable.\n\n\nRevokable: whether the Token Manager can revoke a token grant in the middle of the vesting. When that happens, tokens that are not vested yet are transferred back to the Token Manager.\n\n\n\n\nCalculating transferable tokens\n\n\nA token holder can have multiple vestings at the same time. For checking whether an amount of tokens can be transferred, the contract will check for all the vestings a holder has how many tokens can be transferred at that moment (note that some of the tokens may have been assigned without vesting).\n\n\nFor every vesting, the amount:\n\n\n\n\nFrom start to cliff, 0 tokens are transferable.\n\n\nFrom cliff to vesting, the amount of transferable tokens is interpolated using this formula: \ntransferable = tokens * (now - start) / (vesting - start)\n\n\nAfter vesting, all tokens are transferrable.\n\n\n\n\nForwarder\n\n\nToken Manager allows holders of its underlying token to execute external actions by identifying themselves as token holders. This can be used for allowing token holders to perform a particular action in the DAO (e.g create a vote) without the ACL having to know anything about tokens.\n\n\nFor this, Token Manager conforms to the \naragonOS Forwarder interface\n and forwards calls to holders that own at least one token.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nIn order to avoid an attack in which too many token vestings are added to a holder to cause an out of gas, the amount of token vestings a holder is limited to 50.",

Every transaction occurs in an accounting period and counts towards its token statement.\n\n\nTransactions cannot be created directly, they are recorded as the result of an operation (either a payment being executed or a deposit made).\n\n\nPayments\n\n\nPayments are the construct used for spending using the Finance app. A payment can be created to happen only once or it can be a recurring payment that will be performed according to a certain time schedule.\n\n\nIf executing a payment succeeds, it creates an outgoing transaction with a reference to the payment.\n\n\nBudgets\n\n\nBudgets give the ability to limit how much units of a token can be spent per Accounting period. Budgets are set in a token per token basis. By default no token has a budget, which means unlimited spending is allowed.\n\n\nOnce a budget has been set for a token, the Finance app will only allow the budgeted amount of tokens to be spent for that period.\n\n\nInitialization\n\n\nInitializing a Finance app requires the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nVault:\n a reference to a \nVault\n instance that the Finance app will use for depositing and spending tokens. In order for it to work correctly, the Finance app \nmust have permissions to transfer Vault's tokens\n.\n\n\nEther token\n: address of the EtherToken instance used as ether.\n\n\nAccounting period duration\n: the initial duration for accounting periods. Can later be changed for future periods.\n\n\n\n\nLifecycle\n\n\nDeposits\n\n\nTwo deposit mechanisms are supported:\n\n\nERC20\n\n\ntoken.approve(finance, amount)\nfinance.deposit(token, amount, string reference)\n\n\n\n\nAfter doing an ERC20 approval with the Finance app as spender, calling \ndeposit(...)\n will create an incoming transaction saving the reference string.\n\n\nERC677\n\n\ntoken.transferAndCall(finance, amount, string reference)\n\n\n\n\nPerforming a ERC677 \ntransferAndCall(...)\n to the Finance app will also trigger a deposit (intercepted with the \ntokenFallback\n). The data passed as payload to transferAndCall is used directly as the reference for the deposit.\n\n\nGiven that aragonOS' EtherToken implementation conforms to ERC677, depositing Ether to the Finance app can be done by wrapping the ether using \netherToken.wrap()\n and then doing a \ntransferAndCall(...)\n or using the shortcut \nwrapAndCall(...)\n which performs both actions.\n\n\nPlease note that this section is subject to change as the \nERC677 discussion\n evolves.\n\n\nPayments\n\n\nDepending on the parameters a payment is created with, it can be an instant one time payment, a recurrent payment for payroll or a scheduled payment.\n\n\nCreating payment\n\n\nfinance.newPayment(...)\n\n\n\n\nA payment is created with the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nToken\n: Address of token for payment.\n\n\nReceiver\n: Address that will receive payment.\n\n\nAmount\n: units of token that are payed every time the payment is due.\n\n\nInitial payment time\n: timestamp for when the first payment is done.\n\n\nInterval\n: number of seconds that need to pass between payment transactions.\n\n\nMaximum repeats\n: maximum instances a payment can be executed.\n\n\n\n\nIn case a payment can already be executed on creation, it will be executed.\n\n\nIf a payment is created that won't be repeated ever again, and already was executed, only an outgoing transaction is recorded to save storage.\n\n\nA payment can have a past \ninitial payment time\n, which could cause many instances of the recurring payment to be executed at payment creation time.\n\n\nExecuting payment\n\n\nfinance.executePayment(uint256 _paymentId)\nfinance.receiverExecutePayment(uint256 _paymentId)\n\n\n\n\nPayment execution will transfer the recipient of a payment the amount due depending on the current time. A single execution can result in multiple transactions if the payment hasn't been executed in time. To prevent it going out of gas when many transfers are due, a maximum amount of transfers are performed per execution (multiple executions could be needed in some instances).\n\n\nPayments can always be executed by its recipient, but there is also an additional role to the Finance app that allows another entity to execute the payment (recipient gets the funds in both instances).\n\n\nFor payments whose token is the known EtherToken, instead of doing a token transfer, it will directly transfer ether to the recipient.\n\n\nA payment execution can fail in case the organization is out of budget for the payment token for that particular accounting period, or the organization doesn't have enough token balance.\n\n\nDisabling payments\n\n\nfinance.setPaymentDisabled(uint256 _paymentId, bool _disabled)\n\n\n\n\nAt any time, a payment can be disabled by an authorized entity. If a payment hasn't been fully executed until that time and it is disabled, the recipient won't be able to execute it until it is enabled again.\n\n\nPeriods\n\n\nSetting duration\n\n\nfinance.setPeriodDuration(uint64 _periodDuration)\n\n\n\n\nSets the period duration for next periods. The current period duration cannot be modified.\n\n\nSetting budget\n\n\nfinance.setBudget(ERC20 _token, uint256 _amount)\n\n\n\n\nUpdates the budget of a token for accounting periods. Newly set budget is automatically enforced for the current period.\n\n\nRemoving budget\n\n\nfinance.removeBudget(ERC20 _token)\n\n\n\n\nRemoves budget for a token, allowing unlimited spending of that token in any period. Removing budget affects the current period.\n\n\nTransitioning periods\n\n\nfinance.tryTransitionAccountingPeriod(uint ttl)\n\n\n\n\nAll operations that can result in the creation of a transaction (creating a payment, executing a payment, performing a deposit) first check whether the accounting period needs to be transitioned (previous period has end time has passed) or it can be triggered manually by calling \ntryTransitionAccountingPeriod(...)\n.\n\n\nIf many periods passed (last operation occurred two periods ago, but never transitioned), an empty period is created for every one of them.\n\n\nTo prevent the case in which the Finance app cannot perform any operation because it needs to transition too many accounting periods, causing any operation to go out of gas, transitioning periods has a parameter for how many periods it will transition. Automatic transitions will only perform 10 transitions maximum, and if more were needed the operation will fail. In case this lock occurs and periods cannot be automatically transitioned, multiple period transitions operations can be triggered manually to remove the lockup.\n\n\nLimitations\n\n\n\n\nPayments are allowed to be created but can make it go out of budget. It can cause a race to execute payments right at the beginning of an Accounting period.\n\n\nPayment executions do not expire. There is an attack vector in which by not executing a payment in some time, a budget can be impacted when executed. In case this is happening, payment can be executed by another allowed entity or it could be disabled.",

Use the \"Old UI\", not the \u201cBeta UI\u201d. If you are currently using the Beta UI, you can switch to the Old UI by toggling the UI switch on the Settings page of your MetaMask extension. Aragon Core currently only runs on testnet, so make sure the network in MetaMask is set to Rinkeby Test Network.\n\n\nTest ether for the Ethereum Rinkeby test network. This test ether is used to pay for gas when creating and participating in DAOs on testnet. You can try the \nRinkeby faucet\n or post your Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address in the \n#faucet channel on Aragon Chat\n to receive test ether for free. If you post your faucet request in the Aragon Chat, please wait patiently for an Aragon team member to see your message.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new Democracy DAO\n\n\nStep 1. Navigate to \napp.aragon.one\n in your web browser and click \u201cCreate a new organization\u201d\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Select \u201cToken project with Democracy\u201d then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\nA \u201cToken project with Democracy\u201d is a DAO where the vote cast by a token holder is weighted proportionally to their ownership stake of DAO tokens. For example, if a tokenholder owns 5% of the tokens minted by the DAO then their vote will count as 5% of the total votes on a given proposal.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Claim a domain name then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\nAragon Core uses the Ethereum Name System (ENS) to assign names to DAOs.\n\n\nNote: This name currently cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Set the parameters of your Democracy DAO then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSupport\u201d is the number for what percent of the tokens that participated in a vote must approve a proposal for that proposal to pass. For example, if \u201cSupport\u201d is set to 51%, then 51% of tokens that vote on a proposal must approve the proposal for it to pass.\n\n\n\u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is short for \u201cMinimum Acceptance Quorum. \u201cMin. Quorum\u201d is the number for what percent of the total outstanding supply of token must approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20%, then 20% of the outstanding token supply must vote to approve a proposal for the vote to be considered valid. If a vote does not make quorum, then it will fail, even if more tokens voted to approve the proposal than voted against it. For example, if the Min. Quorum is set to 20% and 10% of the outstanding token supply votes against the proposal but only 15% vote in support, then the proposal will fail because it has not reached the Min. Quorum threshold.\n\n\n\u201cVote Duration\u201d is the length of time that the vote will be open for participation. For example, if the Vote Duration is set to 24 Hours (H), then tokenholders have 24H to participate in the vote. After the 24 hours is over, if the vote has not been approved by a majority of tokenholders and/or does not make quorum, then the vote will automatically fail. If the vote makes quorum and receives approval by a majority of tokenholders by the end of the Vote Duration, then the vote will automatically pass.\n\n\nNote: These parameters cannot currently be changed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Choose token name and symbol then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\nNote: The token name and symbol cannot currently be changed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Sign organization creation transactions\n\n\nNow you need to sign two transactions in MetaMask to create your organization. Open MetaMask if the wallet window does not open automatically. Set the gas limit for each transaction at 6,600,000 to ensure that the transactions succeed. The second transaction may show up in MetaMask as a transaction with a blue dot next to it, indicating that it needs to be signed. Click the blue dot to open the transaction and sign it.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Click \u201cGet Started\u201d\n\n\nYour new Democracy DAO is ready to go!\n\n\n\n\nExplore the Democracy DAO\n\n\nHome app\n\n\nThe Home app welcomes you to your DAO and offers you several options for different actions you can take to interact with your DAO. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your DAO. Aragon Core currently has the Home, Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Settings apps installed, with a Permissions and Apps Manager coming soon.\n\n\n\n\nToken Manager app\n\n\nThe Token Manager is the app you use to mint new tokens and assign them to yourself or other Ethereum accounts.\n\n\n\n\nYou can mint new tokens by following these steps:\n\n\nStep 1. Click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d button\n\n\nEnter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d.\n\n\nNote: If you assign more tokens to other members than you have issued to yourself, you could lose control of your DAO to the other token holders. To maintain control, you will have to always control more tokens than are necessary for a vote to both reach the Min. Quorum and Support thresholds.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Create vote to assign tokens\n\n\nEven though you are the only tokenholder, the Democracy DAO still requires a tokenholder vote for every action. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d to sign the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint.\n\n\nNote: Creating a vote will currently automatically make your account vote \u201cYes\u201d on the proposal. You can change your vote by opening the vote in the Voting app, clicking the \u201cNo\u201d button, and signing the transaction to change your vote to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Sign and send transaction to create the \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d vote\n\n\nAfter clicking \u201cSign Transaction\u201d, a notification will pop-up in MetaMask. Open MetaMask, then sign and send the transaction to create the vote.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Check out the newest member of your DAO!\n\n\nSince you are the only tokenholder, the vote will automatically pass and the token automatically assigned to the account you added in Step 1. A good start to a new Democracy DAO!\n\n\n\n\nVoting app\n\n\nThe voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow DAO tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Democracy DAO.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new vote and poll your community about a topic you care about:\n\n\nStep 1. Click \u201cNew Vote\"\n\n\nFill out the question you want to poll your community about and click \u201cBegin Vote\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Sign transaction to create new vote\n\n\nClick the \u201cSign Transaction\u201d button, then open your MetaMask wallet to sign and send the transaction.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Ask the other DAO token-holders to review and vote on the proposal\n\n\nRally your fellow DAO tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Vote app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Other token-holders cast their vote\n\n\nIn this case, the other tokenholder in the organization does not support deploying the DAO to mainnet quite yet. They sent a follow-up email saying that they\u2019re waiting to receive the results of the last round of security audits before setting a date for the mainnet launch.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Review the vote\n\n\nSince there are only two token-holders in this DAO, and the Support parameter is set to 51%, the even split between yes and no on the example question of whether or not the DAO should be deployed to mainnet next week has resulted in a stalemate vote. Once the vote duration expires, the status of the vote will change to \u201cRejected\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nSettings app\n\n\nThe Settings app is where you can find the internal addresses for your DAO, as well as request test tokens and troubleshoot issues you are having with Aragon Core. If you want to send test ether or tokens to your DAO, make sure to use the Finance app address.\n\n\n\n\nFinance app\n\n\nThe Finance app is the app that provides tokenholders with access to the funds held by their DAO. The Finance app shows current balance in ether and tokens as well as the transaction history of the DAO. You can also use the Finance app to initiate a new transfer of funds.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new transfer from the Finance app:\n\n\nStep 1. Request to have some test tokens sent to your DAO\n\n\nGo to the Settings app and press the \u201cRequest test tokens\u201d button. Open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, test tokens will be sent to the Finance app address of your DAO. You can then create a new transfer to send these tokens to another address.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Click \u201cNew Transfer\u201d to initiate a new transfer from the Finance app\n\n\nEnter the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to send them, along with an optional reference note about what the transfer is for. Then click \u201cSubmit Transfer\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Sign the transaction to create the New Transfer vote\n\n\nAs mentioned before, all actions in the Democracy DAO require a vote by tokenholders. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d then open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction that creates the New Transfer vote.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Ask the other tokenholder in the DAO to review and vote on the transfer\n\n\nThe payment is intended to compensate the other tokenholder in the DAO for contracting work they did, so they waste no time reviewing and voting to approve the transfer.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. The vote transaction is signed and sent to approve the transfer\n\n\nIn blockchain we trust. Amen.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Review the transfer in the Finance app\n\n\nGo back to the Finance app to see a record of the transfer and a link to the transaction record on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new Multisig DAO\n\n\nStep 1. Navigate to \napp.aragon.one\n in your web browser and click \u201cCreate a new organization\u201d\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Select \u201cToken project with Multisig\u201d then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\nA \u201cToken project with Multisig\u201d is a DAO where the resources of the DAO are controlled by m-of-n members of a multisig contract, where n is 100% of tokenholders and m is the Min. Quorum percentage of tokenholders that must approve a vote for it to pass. For example, in a 2-of-2 multisig DAO, two signatures from two different specified accounts are required for a proposal to pass.\n\n\nIf more tokens are minted for additional accounts, then the number of signatures required may increase as well to maintain the required Min. Quorum. For example, starting with a 2-of-3 multisig (66% Min. Quorum) and issuing one token to a new account will make the DAO a 3-of-4 multisig, issuing one more token to yet another new account will make the DAO a 4-of-5 multisig, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Claim a domain name then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\nAragon Core uses the Ethereum Name System (ENS) to assign names to DAOs.\n\n\nNote: This name currently cannot be changed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Enter the accounts and the parameters of the multisig contract\n\n\nFirst enter the addresses of the accounts that you want to be members of the multisig. Then set the number of signatures out of those accounts that will be required to approve votes in the multisig. For example, you can enter three accounts and require any two of their signatures to approve a vote. Up to six signers can be added during the DAO creation process. If you need additional signers, you can add them after the DAO is created by minting a token for each of the accounts you want to join the DAO.\n\n\nNote: These accounts cannot currently be removed from the multisig.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Choose token name and symbol then click \u201cNext\u201d\n\n\nNote: The token name and symbol cannot currently be changed.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Sign organization creation transactions\n\n\nNow you need to sign two transactions in MetaMask to create your organization. Open MetaMask if the wallet window does not open automatically. If your multisig DAO has two or less signers, set the gas limit for each transaction at 6,600,000 to ensure that the transactions succeed. If your multisig DAO has three or more signers, set the gas limit to 7,200,000. The second transaction may show up in MetaMask as a transaction with a blue dot next to it, indicating that it needs to be signed. Click the blue dot to open the transaction and sign it.\n\n\n\n\nStep 7. Click \u201cGet Started\u201d\n\n\nYour new Multisig DAO is ready to go!\n\n\n\n\nExplore the Multisig DAO\n\n\nHome app\n\n\nThe Home app welcomes you to your DAO and offers you several options for different actions you can take to interact with your DAO. You can also use the menu on the left-hand side of the screen to view the different apps that are currently installed for your DAO. Aragon Core currently has the Home, Token Manager, Voting, Finance, and Settings apps installed, with a Permissions and Apps Manager coming soon.\n\n\n\n\nVoting app\n\n\nThe voting app makes it easy for you to poll your fellow DAO tokenholders about their position on an infinite range of topics. Votes initiated by other Aragon apps also show up in the Voting app. For example, assigning tokens using the Token Manager or moving funds from the Finance app are each actions that require a vote by tokenholders in a Multisig DAO.\n\n\n\n\nSettings app\n\n\nThe Settings app is where you can find the internal addresses for your DAO, as well as request test tokens and troubleshoot issues you are having with Aragon Core. If you want to send test ether or tokens to your DAO, make sure to use the Finance app address.\n\n\n\n\nFinance app\n\n\nThe Finance app is the app that provides tokenholders with access to the funds held by their DAO. The Finance app shows current balance in ether and tokens as well as the transaction history of the DAO. You can also use the Finance app to initiate a new transfer of funds.\n\n\n\n\nFollow these steps to create a new transfer from the Finance app:\n\n\nStep 1. Request to have some test tokens sent to your DAO\n\n\nGo to the Settings app and press the \u201cRequest test tokens\u201d button. Open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction. About a minute or so after your transaction is confirmed, test tokens will be sent to the Finance app address of your DAO. You can then create a new transfer to send these tokens to another address.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Click \u201cNew Transfer\u201d to initiate a new transfer from the Finance app\n\n\nEnter the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet address of the recipient and the amount of tokens to send them, along with an optional reference note about what the transfer is for. Then click \u201cSubmit Transfer\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Sign the transaction to create the New Transfer vote\n\n\nAll actions in the Multisig DAO require an approval vote from m-of-n tokenholders. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d then open MetaMask to sign and send the transaction that creates the New Transfer vote.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4. Ask the other tokenholder in the DAO to review and vote on the transfer\n\n\nIn this example, the payment is intended to compensate the other tokenholder in the DAO for contracting work they did, so they waste no time reviewing and voting to approve the transfer.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. The vote transaction is signed and sent to approve the transfer\n\n\nIn blockchain we trust. Amen.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Review the transfer in the Finance app\n\n\nGo back to the Finance app to see a record of the transfer and a link to the transaction record on the blockchain.\n\n\n\n\nToken Manager app\n\n\nThe Token Manager is the app you use to mint new tokens and assign them to other Ethereum accounts.\n\n\n\n\nYou can mint new tokens by following these steps:\n\n\nStep 1. Click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d button\n\n\nEnter the address of the recipient of the tokens and the number of new tokens you want to mint and assign to that address, then click \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d.\n\n\nNote: Each token-holder in a multisig organization can only hold one token at a time. An error will be shown and the transaction will fail if you attempt to mint additional tokens for existing token-holders.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Create vote to assign tokens\n\n\nAs mentioned before, in a Multisig DAO m-of-n tokenholders are needed to approve every action. Click \u201cSign Transaction\u201d to sign the transaction that creates a new vote to assign the new token you want to mint.\n\n\nNote: Creating a vote will currently automatically make your account vote \u201cYes\u201d on the proposal. You can change your vote by opening the vote in the Voting app, clicking the \u201cNo\u201d button, and signing the transaction to change your vote to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Sign and send transaction to create the \u201cAssign Tokens\u201d vote\n\n\nAfter clicking \u201cSign Transaction\u201d, a notification will pop-up in MetaMask. Open MetaMask, then sign and send the transaction to create the vote.\n\n\nStep 4. Ask the other DAO token-holders to review and vote on the proposal\n\n\nRally your fellow DAO tokenholders outside the app - for example, by email, forum, chat room, or good old fashioned face-to-face - and ask them to review and vote on the proposal. Tokenholders can visit the Voting app to see the list of open votes and cast their ballot accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5. Other token-holders cast their vote\n\n\nIn this case, the other tokenholder in the organization is happy to add a new member. They sent a follow-up email saying that they'll vote right away.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6. Check out the newest member of your Multisig DAO\n\n\nGo back to the Token Manager and see that the member you added is now in the list of tokenholders.",

This post aims to be a resource for anyone who wants to set up any kind of organization using Aragon\u2019s technology, \nwhich released its beta just a few days ago\n. It\u2019s supposed to function as a workshop in which creators find the initial guidance necessary to start experimenting with the possibilities of DAOs, the new kind of digital organizations!\n\n\nThe style of the guidelines that follow is very basic: someone with pretty much no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Ethereum should get a solid understanding of the mechanics on how to create a DAO on top of Aragon following 3 simple steps.\n\n\n\n\nAragon\u2019s beta version is now live on the Rinkeby Testnet, and here we\u2019ll talk about that version (Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect). For future deploys, we\u2019ll make additional posts.\n\n\n\n\nThe Basics\n\n\nWhat is a DAO?\n\n\nDAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is an organization built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, a set of smart contracts that allow for organizations to operate following new governance models that will make even Silicon Valley startups seem \ntraditional\n. I wrote more deeply about Decentralized Autonomous Organizations' nature \nhere\n.\n\n\nBenefits of a DAO\n\n\n\n\nCan\u2019t be censored\n\n\nProgrammable governance modules for different organization models\n\n\nTokens\n easily and transparently distributed\n\n\nOperates under a \ndigital jurisdiction\n in our current digital era\n\n\nNo central power can be corrupted\n\n\nEasier to attract talent around the globe to contribute to the organization\u2019s mission\n\n\nVarious entities: people, other orgs, software\u2026\n\n\nTransparent transactions\n\n\n... many more!\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Aragon do?\n\n\nAragon does many useful things! First and foremost, Aragon \nprovides simple software for the setup of any organization\n. Within a few clicks and very little cost, you can start running a digital organization. Sounds good huh? It also provides a digital jurisdiction for governance and dispute resolution: \nthe Aragon Network\n.\n\n\nTo understand Aragon\u2019s mission in the crypto & DAO space, you can check a little post I made about it, or watch an awesome video released by the team!\n\n\nThe Aragon Mission\n\n\n\n\nEmpowering unstoppable organizations through freedom of collaboration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nSo, you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re creating an organization in 21st century fashion? Awesome! Let\u2019s dive into the \n3 simple steps\n you have to follow to get started using the software that will facilitate the organization\u2019s operations from now on.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf7c Step 1: basic Ethereum tools\n\n\nWe\u2019ll take for granted you know a little bit about what a blockchain is and what Ethereum does (if not, there\u2019s plenty of information online for you to dive into). Yet, some tools and terms might seem confusing, so we\u2019ll outline some very easy to follow definitions about key tools that you must know to set up a DAO.\n\n\nEther\n: Ethereum\u2019s currency/token. The fees to set up the organization, vote, etc. will be paid in ether.\n\n\n(Rinkeby) Testnet\n: Ethereum network built for testing purposes where the ether transacted is virtual; \ndoesn\u2019t hold real value\n. Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect is deployed on this testnet. To get faucet funds for the Rinkeby Testnet, \nfollow this link\n.\n\n\nMetaMask\n is a browser extension that allows you to interact with Ethereum Dapps (like Aragon) directly from Chrome, Firefox or Brave. More info and installation help can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\nEtherscan\n allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum. Aragon 0.5 will point us to Etherscan when we want to check transaction history of the apps, and some other activities we\u2019ll see now.\n\n\n\ud83d\udc23 Step 2: create the DAO\n\n\nReady to create your DAO? Visit \naragon.one\n and click on the blue button on the top right corner that says \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d. That will open up a very intuitive initial menu where you must provide the basic infrastructure of your organization.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, you will have to choose between using Democracy or Multisig for your Token project. Multisig is still very early in the making and has pretty much no utility at the moment, so we\u2019ll move forward with Democracy.\n\n\n\n\nSecond, you must claim a domain name in \n_\n.\naragonid.eth\n fashion. We chose workshop.aragonid.eth, as shown below, and clicked Next.\n\n\n\n\nThird, we must choose 3 metrics for our Democracy project. They are Support (%), Minimum Quorum (%) and Vote Duration (time). Support is the % of votes an outcome must get to be a winning outcome (in this case, we chose a simple 50% majority). Min.Quorum is the minimum % of token holders that must participate for the vote to be accepted, for which we chose 23% as an example (Min.Quorum can be a bit confusing specially for small organizations: we\u2019ll take a deeper look later when working with the Voting app). Vote Duration represents the time a vote is open; we chose 72 hours.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we have to choose the name and symbol for our DAO\u2019s token. We wrote AWK as the ticker.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we must sign two transactions (Token Creation and Organization Creation) with our MetaMask wallet. Testnet price to set up the DAO was ~$50 at the time of the experiment, which depends mostly on the Ethereum Network fees. Remember, it\u2019s virtual ether for now!\n\n\n\n\nClicking twice on Submit (green button) should finish the process, and you should get a message like the one below. Congratulations! Your DAO is ready. Let\u2019s click on Get Started!\n\n\n\n\nWhen we click on the blue Get Started button, we are entering our Aragon DAO for the first time. Exciting! The homepage should present us with four functions regarding the 3 apps available. We\u2019ll now take a deeper look into each one of those.\n\n\n\n\nP.S. This is the creation process for a DAO on Aragon. To enter the DAO afterwards, we must simply open it after clicking \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d on \naragon.one\n by entering its name and clicking on \u201cOpen organization\u201d, as shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcce Step 3: use the apps you need\n\n\nNow that we\u2019ve set up our DAO, we can use the three apps available (for now). They are Token Manager, Voting and Finance, and we\u2019ll also look at the DAO\u2019s settings. They all can be accessed by clicking on the menu at the left of the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udcca Token Manager\n\n\nThe Token Manager lets you distribute your organization\u2019s tokens amongst stakeholders. At first, the MetaMask wallet address you used for the creation of the DAO will own 100% of the tokens.\n\n\n\n\nTo assing tokens to other DAO members, click on the blue button at the top right corner that says \u201cAssing Tokens\u201d. There, you must provide a valid Ethereum Address for the Recipient of the tokens, and the number of tokens you want to mint. We have chosen to mint 0.1 tokens for the address below.\n\n\n\n\nThis action will inherently open a vote about the decision to mint the tokens, with your vote in favor. Since you\u2019ll be the only token holder at the moment, the vote will automatically close with a Yes. You\u2019ll have to sign the transaction using MetaMask.\n\n\n\n\nAfter assigning tokens to a couple of addresses, your Token Manager should look somewhat like this (check total token distribution at the right of the screen):\n\n\n\n\nFor a more technical description of the Token Manager, see \nhere\n.\n\n\n\u270b Voting\n\n\nThe Voting app is an entity that will execute a set of actions on other entities if token holders of the DAO decide to do so. To open up a new vote, click on the top right corner \u201cNew Vote\u201d button. Then, we must simply state what the vote is for, and click on Begin Vote. You\u2019ll have to confirm the transaction through MetaMask (it\u2019ll open itself automatically).\n\n\n\n\nTo see the details of a certain vote, you can click on View Vote at the right of the screen. It should open up a dashboard like the one below. Remember that you have to be a token holder to be able to participate in a vote in a certain DAO.\n\n\n\n\nThere, we have the Status of the vote, the Quorum (this is set when setting up the DAO), the Question, its creator, and the current results.\n\n\nIn the Workshop\u2019s case, I am holder of 76% of the DAO\u2019s tokens, so as soon as I voted on something (you automatically vote Yes when creating a vote) the vote was closed (as seen in the screenshot). This was confusing at first, but makes sense mathematically; Quorum and Support were met as soon as I voted! I would recommend to keep this in mind when allocating tokens for testing purposes with your fellow creators or partners, otherwise you won\u2019t be able to really try out Voting.\n\n\nFor a more technical description of the Voting app, see \nhere\n.\n\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 Finance\n\n\nThe purpose of the Finance app is keeping track of income and expenses in your organization, as well as performing payments. At first, your finances will look somewhat empty, as the DAO holds no funds of her own yet.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use your MetaMask wallet to send some funds to the DAO, or use some other Rinkeby options available for fund transfer.

Hey there fellow creators! This post aims to be a resource for anyone who wants to set up any kind of organization using Aragon\u2019s technology,  which released its beta just a few days ago . It\u2019s supposed to function as a workshop in which creators find the initial guidance necessary to start experimenting with the possibilities of DAOs, the new kind of digital organizations!  The style of the guidelines that follow is very basic: someone with pretty much no knowledge of cryptocurrencies or Ethereum should get a solid understanding of the mechanics on how to create a DAO on top of Aragon following 3 simple steps.   Aragon\u2019s beta version is now live on the Rinkeby Testnet, and here we\u2019ll talk about that version (Aragon 0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect).

Etherscan  allows you to explore and search the Ethereum blockchain for transactions, addresses, tokens, prices and other activities taking place on Ethereum.

That will open up a very intuitive initial menu where you must provide the basic infrastructure of your organization.   First, you will have to choose between using Democracy or Multisig for your Token project. Multisig is still very early in the making and has pretty much no utility at the moment, so we\u2019ll move forward with Democracy.   Second, you must claim a domain name in  _ . aragonid.eth  fashion. We chose workshop.aragonid.eth, as shown below, and clicked Next.   Third, we must choose 3 metrics for our Democracy project. They are Support (%), Minimum Quorum (%) and Vote Duration (time). Support is the % of votes an outcome must get to be a winning outcome (in this case, we chose a simple 50% majority). Min.Quorum is the minimum % of token holders that must participate for the vote to be accepted, for which we chose 23% as an example (Min.Quorum can be a bit confusing specially for small organizations: we\u2019ll take a deeper look later when working with the Voting app). Vote Duration represents the time a vote is open; we chose 72 hours.   Next, we have to choose the name and symbol for our DAO\u2019s token. We wrote AWK as the ticker.   Finally, we must sign two transactions (Token Creation and Organization Creation) with our MetaMask wallet. Testnet price to set up the DAO was ~$50 at the time of the experiment, which depends mostly on the Ethereum Network fees. Remember, it\u2019s virtual ether for now!   Clicking twice on Submit (green button) should finish the process, and you should get a message like the one below. Congratulations! Your DAO is ready. Let\u2019s click on Get Started!   When we click on the blue Get Started button, we are entering our Aragon DAO for the first time. Exciting! The homepage should present us with four functions regarding the 3 apps available. We\u2019ll now take a deeper look into each one of those.   P.S. This is the creation process for a DAO on Aragon. To enter the DAO afterwards, we must simply open it after clicking \u201cTry Aragon Core 0.5\u201d on  aragon.one  by entering its name and clicking on \u201cOpen organization\u201d, as shown below.",

There, you must provide a valid Ethereum Address for the Recipient of the tokens, and the number of tokens you want to mint. We have chosen to mint 0.1 tokens for the address below.   This action will inherently open a vote about the decision to mint the tokens, with your vote in favor. Since you\u2019ll be the only token holder at the moment, the vote will automatically close with a Yes. You\u2019ll have to sign the transaction using MetaMask.

It should open up a dashboard like the one below. Remember that you have to be a token holder to be able to participate in a vote in a certain DAO.   There, we have the Status of the vote, the Quorum (this is set when setting up the DAO), the Question, its creator, and the current results.  In the Workshop\u2019s case, I am holder of 76% of the DAO\u2019s tokens, so as soon as I voted on something (you automatically vote Yes when creating a vote) the vote was closed (as seen in the screenshot). This was confusing at first, but makes sense mathematically; Quorum and Support were met as soon as I voted!

We decided that just using Ethereum as the settlement layer was not enough, because if a significant part of the infrastructure depended on centralized servers, we would quickly become a central point of failure that could be taken down.\n\n\n\n\nManifesto-based organizations\n\n\nHow to fix soulless corporations from making everyone miserable\n\n\n\n\nIn the ideal world, every organization has a manifesto with its mission and values. Those values could be ranked, just like in the Aragon Manifesto.\n\n\nIf an organization fails to follow their manifesto, users can point out the value they broke.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly Issue 06 is out!\n\n\nThe latest issue of the community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem\n\n\n\n\nAragon Monthly is a community curated digital newspaper about DAOs, governance and the Aragon ecosystem. Created by the community, for the community.\n\n\n\n\nOn Signaling and Social Pressure\n\n\nHow the Ethereum community could begin making meaningful signaling-based decisions\n\n\n\n\nWith the recent \nMainnet release of our Survey app\n, I would like to propose the idea of Signaling DAOs as a way for stakeholder groups to self organize and produce clear signals. A Signaling DAO could be created by anyone, but in order for it to be impactful it should attempt to be representative of a relevant stakeholder group.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Aggregation Theory \ud83d\udc08\n\n\nExploring how the valuation models fail to account for protocol commoditization\n\n\n\n\nThis post explores how the valuation models used to evaluate decentralized service protocols leveraging \u201cwork\u201d tokens fail to account for protocol commoditization. \n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nAragon Core v0.5.1 Post Mortem\u200a\u2014\u200aPart 1\n\n\nSummary of our first new development cycle\n\n\n\n\nOur initial goal is to establish three two-week sprints. These sprints define a six week cycle. We established this goal as a starting point for the new product development process. The goal emerged from a discussion at our last offsite meeting in Switzerland. 0.5.1 started immediately after the offsite, on 16 April 2018.\n\n\n\n\nOpening applications for the Building DAOs video series\n\n\nJoin us in building your own customized DAO on Ethereum\n\n\n\n\nWith the recent launch of Aragon Core v0.5 we have seen a lot of renewed interest from people wanting to use Aragon to build their own decentralized organizations, or DAOs for short. To help kick off the process, we are excited to invite our community to participate in Building DAOs, an educational video series that will feature the Aragon One developer team working side-by-side with community members and their teams to configure their smart contracts and build their DAOs.\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nAragon launches Survey app on Mainnet\n\n\nFirst Aragon app launched on Ethereum Mainnet for community sentiment signaling\n\n\n\n\nToday we are releasing an entirely new step for community members to signal their sentiment on the project and igniting the next level of participation in the project for all ANT holders.\n\n\nSurvey app is the fourth app developed by our team in addition to the Token Manager, Voting & Finance apps seen previously in Aragon Core v0.5. And the first one to launch on the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network\u200a\u2014\u200aOn a path towards a digital jurisdiction\n\n\nLaunch of a new edition of the Aragon Network whitepaper and our research forum\n\n\n\n\nAs we have continued on our journey thinking about the challenges of creating a jurisdiction designed to be inclusive of DAOs and other pseudoanynomous entities, the economics and mechanisms in the original whitepaper have continued to evolve. Thus far, this progression has mostly been loose thoughts scattered among various chats and in-person conversations. But as development of the underlying infrastructure to support the network is maturing, the need for formalizing how the Aragon Network will operate grows. \n\n\n\n\nAragon Q1 Transparency Report\n\n\nA recap of what has been going on with Aragon during Q1 2018\n\n\n\n\nAs per our Transparency Model, we do quarterly Transparency Reports of our use of funds and about the overall progress of the project. \n\n\n\n\nReleasing the Aragon Developer Portal\n\n\nA new command line tool for building Aragon apps, a straightforward tutorial, and reference documentation for all the building blocks\n\n\n\n\nToday, we introduce tools and documentation for:\n\n\n\n\naragonOS, the smart contract framework that provides upgradeability and governance solutions out-of-the-box\n\n\nAragon UI, for a beautiful frontend experience\n\n\naragon.js, in the middle connecting the two together\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon\u2019s development III: Onboarding new teams\n\n\nIncentivizing new teams to work on common Aragon infrastructure\n\n\n\n\nWe have already explained why we are decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development, how we are decentralizing the legal vehicle that represents the project and introduced Aragon One, the first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development. In this post, we will lay out the strategy for onboarding more teams to work on core Aragon infrastructure. \n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon One\n\n\nThe first company contributing to Aragon\u2019s development\n\n\n\n\nSince we released the first version of the Aragon whitepaper, we knew that it was important to split the non-profit entity overseeing the project from the actual companies or teams working on its development.\n\n\nToday, we are announcing the next step. We are announcing Aragon One.\n\n\n\n\nFirst community-wide Aragon Feedback Survey!\n\n\nTell us what you think of Aragon and how we can improve the project in the future\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have released Aragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200aThe Architect\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s time to hear your thoughts on how has your experience with it been and how can we improve it in the future. This survey is about the Aragon project in general, so you can take part even if you haven\u2019t used the app yet! \n\n\n\n\nAragon Q1 Development Update\n\n\nProgress of development from the first quarter of 2018\n\n\n\n\nReleasing Aragon Core v0.5, The Architect, was the biggest development milestone during the first quarter of the year. \n\n\n\n\nAragon Nest: First awarded grants\n\n\nFive teams already funded and building is underway\n\n\n\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to introduce the first five projects that we\u2019ve granted funding in order for them to flourish, thrive and to pursue their goals of advancing these ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Manifesto\n\n\nA pledge to fight for freedom\n\n\n\n\nWe believe humankind should use technology as a liberating tool to unleash all the goodwill and creativity of our species, rather than as a tool to enslave and take advantage of one another.\n\n\nThus, Aragon is a fight for freedom. Aragon empowers freedom by creating liberating tools that leverage decentralized technologies.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon\u2019s development II: Minimum Viable Foundation\n\n\nReducing the Aragon Foundation to its minimum in order to decentralize the governance and development of the project\n\n\n\n\nWe have previously shared our plans to transform the Aragon project to a community governed project. As described in the decentralizing Aragon\u2019s development post, reducing the Foundation to its minimum is a key step in reaching that goal and decoupling the project from the foundational team working on it, and to level the playground for other teams to jump into the core development of the project.\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nAragon + Zug = \u2764\n\n\nAragon\u2019s legal entity and operations are moving to Zug, Switzerland\n\n\n\n\nWe first met with the government of Zug a year ago, thanks to Ethereum\u2019s cofounder and Aragon\u2019s advisor Mihai Alisie. Mihai set up Ethereum Foundation\u2019s operations in Zug back in the day, and he was one of the early proponents of the Crypto Valley\u200a\u2014\u200aa vibrant crypto ecosystem across Switzerland and Lichtenstein\u200a\u2014\u200awith Zug at its epicenter.\n\n\nBut Zug is a very special place for multiple reasons. Let\u2019s explore them.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Team Update: March 2018\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to\n\n\n\n\nTeam members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nAragon Core v0.5\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201dThe Architect\u201d release\n\n\nThe most powerful Aragon release to date\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re extremely excited to be announcing the next major milestone of the Aragon project along with our brand new video!\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Chris, Aragon\u2019s Product Manager\n\n\nChris is joining the team to enhance the product development process even further\n\n\n\n\nLatest interviewee in our Team Interviews is Chris, Aragon\u2019s new Product Manager! We dive into his thoughts of how Ethereum and Aragon can help change the world for the better, what steps we can take to make creating Aragon an even better process and his philosophy on life.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nAragon Team Update: February 2018\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to\n\n\n\n\nTeam members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

ETHDenver is an Ethereum community event featuring a hackathon and workshops.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Jouni, Aragon\u2019s Design Lead\n\n\nJouni is an experienced designer who\u2019s looking to change the future of society and work\n\n\n\n\nThis time on Team Interviews Jouni, Aragon\u2019s new Design Lead! We get into his previous work designing open source software, what kind of impact technology can have on our global living environment and how he sees Ethereum and the blockchain technology potentially shaping the future of society and work.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Bingen, Aragon\u2019s Solidity Engineer\n\n\nBingen is a developer and an open source advocate joining Aragon to make the world a better place\n\n\n\n\nToday our Team Interview is with Bingen, Aragon\u2019s new Solidity Engineer\u200a\u2014\u200awe talked about his interest to make the world a better place through Aragon, and what are his thoughts on Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\nAragon at ETHDenver\n\n\nAragon is a proud sponsor, mentor, and bounty provider at the ETHDenver hackathon\n\n\n\n\nFor all of February 16\u201318, 2018 you can find several of Aragon team members at the ETHDenver hackathon. We\u2019re proud to be sponsoring this exciting event and are very much looking forward to seeing what people come up with there.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralizing Aragon\u2019s development\n\n\nSplitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon\n\n\n\n\nFor the project to be as resilient as possible, the development of the project should not be controlled by a single central entity. It should be in the hands of the community and multiple different development teams.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing Aragon Labs\n\n\nWhere research meets development\n\n\n\n\nThe goal of Aragon Labs is to enable experimental research and development efforts that move fast and some times break (minor) things. Running these experiments allows us to learn from these experiences. And we can re-iterate and run these experiments for as long as we need. Until we are confident that our tools and products have become stable and mature. That their development has reached a point that signifies them ready to secure valuable ecosystems such as the Aragon Network itself.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Team Update: January 2018\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to\n\n\n\n\nTeam members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine).

The whole platform will be a community effort\u200a\u2014\u200aand it will take time to build it as envisioned.\n\n\nRight now we are a community based project and our long-term plan is to be a community governed project. To learn why this has been our vision for the project, where we are at the moment and how we plan on achieving our goals, let\u2019s take a look into the history and definition of these terms\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing Our Migration To An Open Source Messaging Platform\n\n\nAragon will migrate to Rocket Chat along with 10 other Ethereum projects\n\n\n\n\nToday we are announcing the plan of several Ethereum based projects to migrate to the open source messaging platform Rocket Chat.\n\n\nAragon will be migrating our community out of Slack and onto Rocket Chat in the next couple of weeks.\n\n\nThis has been a joint effort from the projects participating in the migration plan. Aragon initially started the proposal for the community after there had already been discussion on the subject from multiple projects. We came together as members of the same ecosystem and community to work on this plan to find an alternative that fit the needs of these cryptocurrency projects.\n\n\n\n\nAugust\n\n\nWhy Transparency Matters\n\n\nAragon Transparency Model and the unveiling of Aragon\u2019s new Transparency Framework\n\n\n\n\nAt Aragon, we feel obliged to show to our community\u200a\u2014\u200asupporters, contributors and token holders\u200a\u2014\u200athat we are being productive, effective and using the raised funds in a responsible manner.\n\n\nThe community is very important to us, they are the ones that we\u2019re building this project for. They support us, provide feedback and ideas on how we can all move forward while catering the needs of the users. In turn, we want to uphold our high transparency standards to keep the community up to date on what we are doing.\n\n\nThis is why we\u2019re showcasing our model for doing things transparently.\n\n\nThis all began with our Pre-Sale Transparency Report. And recently continued with the Token Buyback Transparency Report.\n\n\nWe\u2019ll now present you with all the different methods we\u2019re employing. The parts of our project\u2019s transparency model, starting with the new Transparency Framework.\n\n\n\n\nToken Buyback Transparency Report\n\n\nWhy did we buy back ANT and how we will disclose these events\n\n\n\n\nToday, adhering to our high transparency standards, we\u2019re ready to take the first step in our plan to extend our level of transparency\u200a\u2014\u200awhich is why we\u2019re reporting our token buybacks.\n\n\nIn our Intended Use of Revenue post we outlined the broad estimated allocation of our funds. As the development of our project has continued, we\u2019ve been able to narrow down some of the use cases of which we\u2019ll use our funds for.\n\n\n\n\nJuly\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Oliver, Aragon\u2019s Senior Full Stack Web3 Engineer\n\n\nOliver and I discussed how he got started with Ethereum, how he came to work at Aragon and where he sees the project going\n\n\n\n\nWe have a new addition to our Dev Team! Today we\u2019re introducing Oliver as a new team member. He expresses his views on Ethereum, his favourite projects and how we can all make Aragon better together.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Jurisdiction Part 1: Decentralized Court\n\n\n\n\nWhen first designing Aragon, the goal was to have organizations run entirely trustless. Thus, we created a platform to create organizations governed by trustless and immutable code. Now, when we say that these organizations run in a trustless manner, we\u2019re talking about how to describe the laws under which the code runs. Code is trustless when deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It won\u2019t change at the whim of a person, it will run as designed, following the logic set forth in it.\n\n\nYet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world. And often, in the case of disputes, things are subjective and up to interpretation.\n\n\nOur solution to this problem is the Aragon Network Jurisdiction. A decentralized jurisdiction to solve subjective disputes as an Aragon Network service.\n\n\n\n\nThe emergent Ethereum stack\n\n\ndistrict0x, the first manifestation of the Ethereum + Aragon stack\n\n\n\n\nSoftware allows us to abstract away from existing functionality to focus on building.\n\n\nAt Aragon, we use Ethereum. Ethereum provides us the consensus layer to establish truth. And the ability to create smart contracts that are self-enforcing.\n\n\nSo, generally speaking, we don\u2019t have to worry about Ethereum. We use Ethereum, driving usage to the platform, thus increasing its value. So we\u2019re indirectly funding its further development.\n\n\nThat\u2019s the virtuous circle that tokenization makes possible.\n\n\n\n\nAragon\u2019s Community Governance Model\n\n\nHow we plan to achieve transparency and inclusion for the community\n\n\n\n\nOur community is everything for us. With Aragon, we want a thousand communities to flourish. Tokens align the incentives of communities and projects towards the same goals and values. But those communities are the center of where the magic happens.\n\n\nTwo weeks ago we posted our Community Governance Model for feedback from the community. We received some comments on it, and we now have the final version of the model ready. Before this, we had already worked on the model internally. I drafted the original version and Luis Cuende and Jorge Izquierdo provided their thoughts on it.\n\n\nFurther changes might be made as things develop. But we wanted to show the community what we\u2019ll be doing in terms of governance, transparency and inclusion.\n\n\nThe model was designed so that every community member will be treated equally. Everyone will have the same changes of participation, and our Meetings and decisions to be transparent.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Mihai Alisie as an Advisor\n\n\nWhy him, why now and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe announced two of our Advisors before the successful ANT sale. Kenny Rowe from the MakerDAO project and Jake Brukhman of CoinFund. Both experts in their fields and respected members of the Ethereum community.\n\n\nWhile we did have our Board of Advisors in place before the token sale, we chose not to disclose all the members then.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q2 Development Update\n\n\nv0.4 release status and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nWe will be delivering regular updates on the development of Aragon. This is our first quarterly update to bring the community up to speed on where we\u2019re at and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nJune\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Mar\u00eda, Aragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\n\n\nMar\u00eda shares her thoughts about Aragon and what got her into working on an Ethereum based project\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Mar\u00eda\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Head of Strategy and Operations\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about her, her interest in Ethereum, how she came to work, and her role, at Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon to power the district0x Network\n\n\nWelcoming district0x to the Aragon Network Jurisdiction\n\n\n\n\nToday, we are pleased to introduce the first resident of the Aragon Network Jurisdiction, the district0x Network\n\n\nThe district0x Network is a collective of decentralized marketplaces and communities powered by Ethereum, Aragon, and IPFS. Markets on the network, also referred to as districts, are all built upon a shared framework comprised of smart contracts and front-end libraries which provide the functionality necessary to operate communal marketplaces which are similar to services like AirBNB, eBay, Uber, or Reddit with payments.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Harsh, Aragon\u2019s Product Engineer\n\n\nHarsh talks about how he came to work on a Ethereum project and where he sees Aragon going in the future\n\n\n\n\nAs a continuation on our team interview series, I interviewed Harsh\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Product Engineer\u2014 to learn more about him, his past ventures, how he came to work on Aragon, and his future vision for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAragon partners with 0x\n\n\nMaking decentralized organizations go beyond Ether\n\n\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we\u2019re partnering with 0x to allow Aragon organizations to accept and operate with any token. 0x is a protocol for decentralized exchange on Ethereum allowing users to exchange tokens without a central broker\u200a\u2014\u200aending the many inefficiencies of centralization by enabling transparent token exchanges between contracts.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Tatu, Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\n\n\nTatu talks about why he is part of the Ethereum community and why he is so enthusiastic about Aragon and decentralization\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our team interview series (Luis\u2019 Interview|Jorge\u2019s Interview), I\u2019ve interviewed Tatu\u2014 Aragon\u2019s Community Lead\u200a\u2014\u200ato learn more about his experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, the projects he\u2019s most excited about, and why he chose to work for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nMay\n\n\nAnnouncing the ENS Aragon Network Company Registry\n\n\n\n\nWith Aragon, we set out to create software that makes it easy to create and run decentralized organizations. However, meaningless ETH addresses made sending funds and completing transactions for operating a business unnecessarily complicated.\n\n\nFortunately, ENS (Ethereum Name Service) recently solved this issue by enabling the assignment of human-readable names to eth addresses. This was important for the entire Ethereum ecosystem (including Aragon)\u2014 no longer do you have to send transactions to a series of numbers and letters.\n\n\nSo today, we\u2019re excited to announce that we won the bid for the name company.eth! In this post, we\u2019ll explain how Aragon organizations will use the name and the implications for Aragon Network user-adoption.\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Token Sale: The Numbers\n\n\nRoughly $25 million was collected in 26 minutes. The rate was $122k/s the first 3 blocks.\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we closed the 4th largest crowdfunding event in history, and the 2nd largest in the blockchain space (after The DAO). Raising 275,000 ether, or roughly $25 million, we\u2019re incredibly humbled by the support of the community and the trust in our mission to make decentralized autonomous organizations widespread.\n\n\nIn this post, we\u2019d like to reflect on the last 48 hours, provide some data on the sale, and most importantly express our gratitude to the community.\n\n\n\n\nFinal token sale recap\n\n\n\n\nPlease read How to Securely Participate in the sale for information and tutorials on how to participate.\n\n\n\n\nPre-Sale Transparency Report\n\n\n\n\nBefore tomorrow\u2019s token sale, we believe it\u2019s important that we release a transparency report about the pre-sale. This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Contracts Have Been Deployed and Activated\n\n\nANT sale begins on Ethereum mainnet\u2019s block 3,723,000\u200a\u2014\u200aMay 17, ~6pm GMT\n\n\n\n\nHow to Participate in the Sale\n\n\n\n\nWait for block 3,723,000 (May 17 at approximately 6pm GMT). You can check what the latest block is on Etherscan. After block 3,722,999 has been mined, it is safe to send the transaction. Note that sending the transaction before that block is mined will result in a loss of fees.\n\n\nSend ETH to the address posted on https://aragon.network\n\n\nSend at least 200,000 gas with your transaction.\n\n\nIf your contribution is accepted, tokens will be transferred to your address in the same transaction. However, tokens will not be transferable until the sale is finalized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Community Multisig\n\n\nA 3/5 multisig that will approve the deployment of the Aragon Network\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token (ANT) will initially begin as an upgradable token, but will evolve to serve as the governance token for the Aragon Network when deployed.\n\n\nWe estimate that the Aragon Network will be deployed in May of 2018. Prior to deployment and transition to a governance token, we plan to perform numerous audits and bug bounties to ensure thorough testing and to mitigate the risk of another DAO hack.\n\n\nHowever, the actual ANT token will be first distributed in 2 days. So this raises the question: how do we plan to upgrade the token\u2019s functionality to a governance token?\n\n\n\n\nToken sale cap clarification\n\n\ntl;dr: Our cap is not $100m, or near that amount\n\n\n\n\nWe have had a lot of questions about our hidden cap mechanism.\n\n\nSince it\u2019s pretty new to the token sale world, we understand the confusion and want to provide a simple breakdown to clarify.\n\n\n\n\nToken Sale Audit Results\n\n\nNo Critical Issues Reported and Token Sale is On-Schedule\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure a stable and safe token sale, we employed the help of Jordi Baylina and Piper Merriam to perform independent audits of Aragon token sale contract code. Jordi and Piper completed their reports this week and published their independent findings (Jordi\u2019s Report | Piper\u2019s Report). No critical issues were reported in either independent audit. And for the issues that were found, we\u2019ve worked closely with Jordi and Piper to resolve them and improve the code.\n\n\nIn addition, we\u2019re happy to announce that there have been no critical issues reported through the bug bounty program. Thanks to all of those that have participated, and note that the bug bounty program will continue indefinitely.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Advisors\n\n\nKenny from MakerDAO and Jake from CoinFund will be advising Aragon\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce two people that we really admire in the Ethereum community will be joining us as advis0rs: Kenny Rowe and Jake Brukhman.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Aragon\n\n\nMaking Aragon Code Accessible and Providing Documentation Soon\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 12, I got my first laptop\u200a\u2014\u200aa piece of junk with only 256MB of RAM. It was slow and literally falling apart. But this didn\u2019t stop me from developing. Using Linux, I had the latest available software. And thanks to thousands of developers around the world, I could examine different pieces of code and learn programming.\n\n\nThe free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon.\n\n\nSo when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so. We\u2019ve found that by sharing code, others can learn from it (like I did as a teenager) and people will find ways to improve it.\n\n\n\n\nHow to Securely Participate in the Aragon Token Sale\n\n\nUsing Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask\n\n\n\n\nThe ANT token sale is happening on May 17th! In anticipation, we\u2019ve been and will continue to frequently post about Aragon and sale details. In this post, we list the sources to trust for ANT sale information, and provide instructions for purchasing with Mist, Parity, My Ether Wallet, and Metamask.\n\n\n\n\nAragon On Tour: Meetups Around the Globe\n\n\nCome to one of our meetups, have a beer with us and talk decentralized awesomeness\n\n\n\n\nOn the Internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. This has been extremely beneficial for the development of communities around the world, and crypto is perhaps one of the most remarkable examples.\n\n\nBut who doesn\u2019t like to have a beer with people that share common interests? It\u2019s part of our human nature!\n\n\nSo aside from being on Slack all day and night, we\u2019ve organized a series of meetups for Ethereum & Aragon enthusiasts to get together to talk about exciting projects and have a few drinks!\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Raising funds with a token\n\n\nHow you can raise capital creating your own token in a few clicks\n\n\n\n\nToken sales are changing the rules of the game, making it extremely easy for anyone in the world to gather capital and build new products.\n\n\nWith Aragon, you can create token sales in a few clicks and publish the sale address so everyone can participate.\n\n\n\n\nOur Public Product Roadmap and Issue Reporting\n\n\nEnhancing transparency in product development\n\n\n\n\nOften, product and software development is secretive and confidential until the official product launch. While this has the effect of building excitement, it can lead to unrealistic user expectations, development of products that are missing key features, and ultimately products that miss end-user needs.\n\n\nAs a result, we believe it\u2019s important to engage the community throughout the product development process\u200a\u2014\u200aand this is what we\u2019ve done while developing Aragon. The community has consistently provided valuable feedback and unique perspectives. From user interface design to our token model, feedback from the Aragon community has guided Aragon Core and Network development.\n\n\n\n\nAragon token sale bug bounty\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to announce that we are conducting a bug bounty in advance of the Aragon Network Token sale. We believe bug bounties are essential to ensuring a safe release, and are especially important when cryptocurrency is being exchanged. This post will provide more details on our bug bounty program scope, the timeline, and compensation.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Tutorial: Tokens and voting\n\n\nHow you can easily create your own token and govern your organization with it\n\n\n\n\nFrom the beginning, we wanted Aragon to be a tool that anyone can use. So we put a lot of thought into making things easy.\n\n\nTo make things even easier, we are starting a series of short videos that explain every part of Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nOur Intended Use of Revenue\n\n\nHow we plan to use the token sale to drive development\n\n\n\n\nAs previously announced, the Aragon Network Token (ANT) sale will be conducted on May 17th. The funds raised will fund Aragon Core development and the Network deployment.\n\n\nThe specific steps and timeline to make Aragon production ready are outlined in our development plan, released last week. In this post, we\u2019re excited to provide details on our intended use of revenue from the token sale.\n\n\n\n\nApril\n\n\nAragon + Status: Bringing decentralized organizations everywhere\n\n\nGetting ready to offer Aragon to 2.3bn smartphone users\n\n\n\n\nOur mission at Aragon is to make decentralized organizations widespread.\n\n\nTo achieve our mission, we built a dApp to easily create and operate decentralized organizations on Ethereum. First, we focused on building a feature rich web and desktop (including MacOS, Linux, and Windows) application.\n\n\nBut our initial focus ignored a major way that over 2.3 billion people interact with applications today: their smartphones. The reason we ignored these users was simple\u200a\u2014\u200athe development effort to create mobile applications is significant and would distract from developing fully featured web and desktop versions.\n\n\n\n\nA note for exchanges or holders interacting with ANT in an automated manner\n\n\n\n\nThe Aragon Network Token has vesting built in that limits the transferability of the token until a specified time.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Token Sale Technical Overview\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: ANT is a MiniMe Token with built-in vesting functionality. Two security audits are currently being performed and a bug bounty will begin soon. ANT contract code is live on Github.\n\n\nThis post will discuss the ANT base token and its functionality, the ANT sale contract, and the current state of ANT security and future efforts to ensure a successful token sale.\n\n\n\n\nThe path to mainstream decentralized organizations\n\n\n\n\nYesterday, we published our development plan for Aragon Core and the Aragon Network. This post explains in greater detail our structure to store and allocate funds from Aragon Network Token (ANT) sales, features of the next Aragon Core release, and plans to deploy the Aragon Network and its first organizations.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Development Plan\n\n\nThe road ahead to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nLast week, we announced our token sale and its terms.\n\n\nToday, we will be addressing the future of Aragon, by releasing our Development Plan.\n\n\n\n\nAragon Network Token sale terms\n\n\nFounder vesting, simple pricing and distribution\n\n\n\n\nYesterday we announced the Aragon Network Token sale. Today, we will go into its details. For a simple overview of the sale in just one page, download the one pager.\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the Aragon Network Token sale\n\n\nANT sale starts on May 17th. Bootstrapping the creation of the world\u2019s first digital jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\nWe have been asked countless times about whether we would do a token sale or not. Our answer always was: if it makes sense, we will!\n\n\nAfter launching Aragon, we spent a lot of time talking to people and thinking. What will be the main issues to make decentralized organizations widespread?\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Luis, Aragon\u2019s Project Lead\n\n\nLuis talks about why he is creating Aragon and his long-term vision for it\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Luis\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Project Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the future of the project, and his long term vision.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing the Aragon Network\n\n\nSolving the biggest hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread\n\n\n\n\nOur first step was to develop an extremely easy to use product on top of the Ethereum blockchain that lets everyone run decentralized organizations. Now we have validated the concept, the market interest and most importantly, the main hurdles to realize our vision.\n\n\nThose main hurdles to make decentralized organizations widespread are upgradeability and decentralized arbitration.\n\n\n\n\nThe 8 pillars of any organization\n\n\nA walk-through of Aragon and the why behind each feature\n\n\n\n\nWhen we set out to create Aragon, we researched what were the core features that an organization needs.\n\n\nLast year, the 11th of November, we came up with the first version of the product full spec. Most of the features that you see today in Aragon, as well as how they are structured, were laid out that month.\n\n\nSince we have been asked a few times which was our thought process to came up with that features, I\u2019ll go through it.\n\n\n\n\nTeam Interviews: Jorge, Aragon\u2019s Tech Lead\n\n\nJorge talks about what excites him the most about Aragon, and the road ahead\n\n\n\n\nI have interviewed my cofounder Jorge\u200a\u2014\u200aAragon\u2019s Tech Lead\u200a\u2014\u200aand asked him about the Ethereum community, his workspace and the road ahead.\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized organizations can solve the world\u2019s worst problems\n\n\nDisintermediating human trade\u200a\u2014\u200abusiness\u200a\u2014\u200ais the first step towards a more fair world\n\n\n\n\nWe take most power for granted. After all, humans enforce most of their social contracts by giving away some freedom.\n\n\nWe usually think about intermediaries in a microscopic scale. We think about the guy who delivered us a package. Or the agency we hired to find us a buyer for an apartment.\n\n\nYet those intermediaries are insignificant compared to the macro-scale intermediaries.\n\n\n\n\nMarch\n\n\nThe Governance Release, Alpha 0.3 \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\n\n\nBring your token, new bylaws, web version and more\n\n\n\n\nTokens are changing the rules of the game. We don\u2019t need to think about obscure business models anymore. We can align our users\u2019 incentives with ours and release a token that implements that logic.\n\n\nAt Aragon we believe that we are at the dawn of this token model.\n\n\nAnd we want to help the community in this journey.\n\n\nSo today, we are introducing ERC20 token support for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nReleasing Aragon Alpha \ud83d\ude80\n\n\n\n\nOne month ago, we introduced our vision of how companies and organizations will work. And we set to make it a reality.  \n\n\nToday, I want to personally thank all the community for the warmest welcome we could have ever dreamed of for Aragon.\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Solidity code deployment techniques\n\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation post to the work we did with Zeppelin for the article on Proxy libraries for code upgradeability. Reading that post is not required in order to understand this one, but it is definitely a recommended read, as the ideas are pretty much on the same line. And towards the end we will combine them.\n\n\n\n\nElectron + MetaMask = Secure, Easy to Use Dapps \ud83d\udd12\n\n\nSandboxing Ethereum DApps with Electron\n\n\n\n\nWhen we chose what would be our main build target for Aragon, our priorities for choosing Electron + MetaMask were security and usability.  \n\n\nOf course Aragon also runs on any Web3 environment (like Mist, Parity, Chrome with MetaMask\u2026) but we wanted to have a build target in which we have full control over the user experience.  \n\n\nSince we got part of the community intrigued on how our implementation works, this post hopes to explain our decisions and the challenges we found.\n\n\n\n\nHow Aragon approaches identity and the Ethereum Keybase Resolver\n\n\n\n\nIdentity is one of the most important parts when developing decentralized applications. This is specially true for Aragon, where identity is needed to know who are you doing business with or who are the people that will manage the money you are investing.\n\n\n\n\nFebruary\n\n\nLibrary Driven Development in Solidity\n\n\n\n\nA comprehensive review on how to develop more modular, reusable and elegant smart contract systems on top of the Ethereum Virtual Machine by using libraries\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing Aragon: Unstoppable companies\n\n\n\n\nToday, taking a stand to help this fight, we are introducing Aragon.\n\nAragon is everything you need to operate your company or organizational structure, on Ethereum.\n\nAragon lets everyone create value without borders or intermediaries.\n\nCap table, vesting, payments, voting, bylaws, fundraising and identity all in a beautiful, unified interface.",

Yet, it was clear that we can\u2019t account for every possible circumstance in our code. Even if you manage to encode tons of variables into the code, there are things you cannot possibly encode because the blockchain isn\u2019t aware about the physical world.

The free software and open source phenomena has not only made the world a more inclusive place, but it has also increased the speed of software development\u200a\u2014\u200aby sharing, developers no longer need to reinvent the wheel. For example, we didn\u2019t have to build the native app wrapper or the Ethereum wallet for Aragon.  So when we find something that we can give back to the community, we make a point of doing so.

This is a very exciting initiative and shows the importance of community involvement to the blockchain movement, some experts argue. See more from the company press release below.\n\n\nIntroducing the \u2018Aragon Nest\u2019 Grants Program\n\n\n\n\nHow The Token Model Is Changing Coding For The Better\n\n\n\n\nFor a long time free and open source software was a niche seen by many as a threat to major software developers and large corporations who wished to enforce stricter intellectual property rights. Although patents and intellectual property rights were originally designed to protect the rights of the creators, in coding this is often enforced to the detriment of the community at large.\n\n\nHowever, during the last decades, open source models were gaining popularity and had a loyal following particularly among Linux enthusiasts.\n\n\nOpen source offers great benefits in the areas of cost, flexibility, freedom, security, and accountability. You can see how the code is developed, what it does, and why. Unlike closed proprietary software, code can be altered and extended by any developer.\n\n\n\n\nCCN\n\n\nEthereum-Based Aragon Raises $25 Million Under 15 Minutes in Record ICO\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-based enterprise management platform Aragon has announced details of its Wednesday ICO token sale, raising a mammoth $25 million.\n\n\nThe token sale saw participation from 2,403 buyers around the world and lasted under 15 minutes to raise the figure for a token sale that was originally set to run until June 14, 2017.\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-Based Aragon Partners ShapeShift for Upcoming Token Sale\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-based distributed network platform Aragon has announced a partnership with leading global exchange ShapeShift in advance of their upcoming token sale. Set to launch May 17th, Aragon counts ICONOMI and CoinFund among its pre-sale buyers.\n\n\nThanks to the partnership with ShapeShift, users will be able to purchase Aragon Network Tokens (ANT) using the variety of tokens on the ShapeShift platform such as Bitcoin, Ether, or Litecoin.\n\n\n\n\nCointelegraph\n\n\nWhy Aragon Co-Founder Sees Ethereum Price Surpassing $1,000\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende revealed that he sees the price of Ethereum, which remains at around $261, hitting $1,000 in the long run.\n\n\nIn an interview with Sindre Hopland, the media producer at Itnig, Cuende explained that the Ethereum market along with the ICO industry is growing at an exponential rate. Both large-scale and small companies are actively investing in the efficiency of Ethereum network in automating operations with the utilization of smart contracts.\n\n\n\n\nBiggest-Ever ICO Jackpot Netted By Ethereum-Based Aragon Despite Bad Actor\n\n\n\n\nEthereum-based business management platform Aragon has raised the largest amount ever in an ICO - almost $25 mln in 15 minutes.\n\n\nThe token sale began at 19:30 GMT on Wednesday, but had already sold out minutes later, with investors contributing a total of 275,000 ETH worth around $24.75 mln.\n\n\n\n\nBankless Times\n\n\nEthereum cofounder Alisie joins Aragon advisory board\n\n\n\n\nDecentralized company management platform Aragon announced this week that original Ethereum cofounder Mihai Alisie has joined its advisory board.\n\n\nMr. Alisie partnered with Vitalik Buterin in 2011 to launch Bitcoin Magazine and later joined him to found Ethereum. He served as strategic manager and vice president of the Ethereum Foundation. The other Aragon advisors are Dai Foundation COO Kenny Rowe and CoinFund cofounder Jake Brukhman.\n\n\n\n\nAudio Interviews\n\n\nAn Ethereum Podcast: Episode #11 | Guest: Luis Cuende and Maria Gomez from Aragon\n\n\n\n\nJoin us to hear more about their new grants program, Aragon Nest as well as how they continue to think about how they are in the process of transforming their DAO-producing organization into a DAO.\n\n\n\n\nThe Boost VC Podcast| Season 2, Ep. 14: Governance, Decentralized Organizations and Valuing Blockchain Technology with Aragon Co-Founder Luis Cuende\n\n\n\n\nListen in as Aragon co-founder Luis Cuende offers his profound insight on the growing popularity of cryptocurrency in Spain, fueled in part by the push for Catalonian independence.\n\n\n\n\nVideo Interviews\n\n\nFLOSS Weekly 467: Aragon\n\n\n\n\nAragon was born to bring transparency and independent governance to the forefront of managing an organization.

Updated Jan. 14th, 2018.\n\n\nAn \nexokernel\n-inspired architecture for modular, upgradeable, and secure DAOs\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nThis exokernel-inspired architecture enables modular, upgradeable, and secure Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It implements a UNIX-inspired permissioning system with smart contracts to allow for safe and efficient control over software resources.\n\n\nSmart contracts, an essential component of the Ethereum ecosystem, can define the rules and penalties around an agreement. They can also make decisions and enforce prior commitments, such as transfering large amounts of funds. However, such significant responsibilities make smart contracts a prime target for attacks. Testing and auditing them are not absolute remedies because, inevitably, humans make mistakes.\n\n\nSo, how does one guarantee DAOs that run efficiently and securely? And how do we provide upgrading capabilities to these DAOs, to ensure the safety and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem?\n\n\nWe present our secure decentralized operating system: \naragonOS\n.\n\n\nThis document provides a technical overview about the architecture. For a less technically-oriented introduction to aragonOS, you can check the \nannouncement blog post\n.\n\n\n1. Kernel and the Access Control List\n\n\nThe \nAccess Control List\n (ACL) is the filter which determines whether an \nentity\n has a certain role in the context of an app. It either permits or prohibits performing actions, such as an update, in a given context, as well as determining the entities with power over that permission.\n\n\nThe ACL permissioning system is inspired by UNIX. ACLs control the permissions afforded to a user in the system and can ease the transfer of said permissions. Similar to the \nsudo\n command in UNIX, users can escalate permissions, but with more flexibility and granularity.\n\n\nA reference implementation of the Kernel and its ACL can be found here: \nKernel.sol\n.\n\n\nApps and Actions\n\n\nApp\ns are smart contracts that rely on the Kernel\u2014the core of the operating system\u2014for maintaining their ACL and upgrading their code. Apps can interact with users and other smart contracts by implementing \nAction\ns, where each action is a publicly-accessible function that may or may not be protected by the ACL. Any actions that are protected are only allowed to be executed if the caller is permitted by the ACL. Because apps are upgradeable, we expect them to exist for a long period of time and be safely responsible for owning assets on behalf of the DAO (e.g. tokens and ENS names).\n\n\nApp instances are identified by their deployed Ethereum addresses. More than one instance of a particular app can be installed in a DAO at a time (e.g. multiple \nToken Manager\n instances can be installed to control multiple tokens).\n\n\nRoles\n\n\nAnother feature in ensuring security within the ecosystem is the ease of delegating responsibilities for autonomous execution. Apps can define any number of \nRole\ns, where each role grants access to one or more of the app's actions as part of the app's ACL. Any entity wishing to perform an action protected by the ACL must have the necessary permissions by having a role that is capable of executing that action.\n\n\nRoles are always unique to each app. Having a given role in one app does not grant the permission to perform that same role in other apps.\n\n\nAn entity can have many roles in one app.\n\n\nExample:\n\n\ncontract TokenApp is App {\n    bytes32 constant public MINT_ROLE = 0x1234;\n    function mint(address _receiver, uint256 _amount) auth(MINT_ROLE) { \u2026 }\n}\n\n\n\n\nTokenApp\n is an app that defines one action, \nmint()\n, whose execution is controlled by \nMINT_ROLE\n.\n\n\nEntity\n\n\nAn \nEntity\n is any actor that is represented by an Ethereum address, such as a multisig (an account that needs multiple signatures before executing an action), an app (for example, a voting app that only executes an action if token holders vote favorably), or a simple private key controlled account.\n\n\nThe system can delegate permissions to groups of entities by implementing a Group app. As in other apps, it can rely on the ACL for protecting important functions, such as adding or removing members of the group. When group members want to execute a specific action, the Group app acts as a proxy contract that performs the action on behalf of the group.\n\n\nPermissions\n\n\nA \nPermission\n is defined as the ability to perform actions (grouped by roles) in a certain app instance (identified by its address).\n\n\nWe refer to a \nPermission Instance\n as an entity holding a certain permission.\n\n\nWhen a permission is created, a \nPermission Manager\n is set for that specific permission. The permission manager is able to grant or revoke permission instances for that permission.\n\n\nCreate Permission\n\n\nkernel.createPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role, address manager)\n\n\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n will fail if that permission has pre-existing permission instances.\n\n\nThis action is identical to \ngrantPermission()\n except it allows the creation of a new permission if it doesn\u2019t exist yet.\n\n\nA role in the ACL protects access to \ncreatePermission()\n as this important function could be used in malicious ways. When the Kernel is initialized, it also creates the permission that grants the initializing address the ability to create new permissions.\n\n\nNote that creating permissions is made mandatory by the ACL: all actions requiring yet-to-be-created permissions are disallowed by default. Any permission checks on non-existent permissions are failed automatically.\n\n\nGrant Permission\n\n\nkernel.grantPermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nGrants \nrole\n in \napp\n for an \nentity\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission. This \nentity\n would then be allowed to call all actions that their \nrole\n can perform on that particular \napp\n until the permission manager revokes their role with \nrevokePermission()\n.\n\n\nThe \ngrantPermission()\n action doesn\u2019t require protection with the ACL because an entity can only make changes to a permission if it is the permission's \nmanager\n.\n\n\nRevoke Permission\n\n\nkernel.revokePermission(address entity, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nRevokes \nrole\n in \napp\n for an \nentity\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission.\n\n\nThe \nrevokePermission()\n action doesn\u2019t need to be protected by the ACL either, as an entity can only make changes if it is the \nmanager\n for a given permission.\n\n\nSet Permission Manager\n\n\nkernel.setPermissionManager(address newManager, address app, bytes32 role)\n\n\n\n\nChanges the permission manager to \nnewManager\n. Only callable by the \nmanager\n of a certain permission.\n\n\nThe new permission manager replaces the old permission manager, resulting in the old manager losing any management power over that permission.\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n executes a special case of this action to set the initial manager for the newly created permission. From that point forward, the manager can only be changed with \nsetPermissionManager()\n.\n\n\nEvents\n\n\ncreatePermission()\n, \ngrantPermission()\n, and \nrevokePermission()\n all fire the same \nSetPermission\n event that Aragon clients are expected to cache and process into a locally stored version of the ACL:\n\n\nSetPermission(address indexed from, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed to, bool allowed)\n\n\n\n\nsetPermissionManager()\n fires the following event:\n\n\nChangePermissionManager(address indexed app, bytes32 indexed role, address indexed manager)\n\n\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAs an example, the following steps show a complete flow for user \"Root\" to create a new DAO with the basic permissions set so that a \nVoting app\n can manage the funds stored in a \nVault app\n:\n\n\n\n\nDeploy the Kernel\n\n\nExecuting \nkernel.initialize(rootAddress)\n creates the \"permissions creator\" permission under the hood:\n\ncreatePermission(rootAddress, kernelAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, rootAddress)\n\n\nDeploy the Voting app\n\n\nGrant the Voting app the ability to call \ncreatePermission()\n:\n\ngrantPermission(votingAppAddress, PERMISSIONS_CREATOR_ROLE, kernelAddress)\n (must be executed by \nrootAddress\n)\n\n\nDeploy the Vault app, which has a action called \ntransferTokens()\n\n\nCreate a new vote via the Voting app to create the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission\n\ncreatePermission(votingAppAddress, vaultAppAddress, TRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE, votingAppAddress)\n\n\nIf the vote passes, the Voting app then has access to all actions in the Vault protected by \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n, which in this case is just \ntransferTokens()\n\n\nFund transfers from the Vault can now be controlled via votes from the Voting app. Each time a user wishes to transfer funds, they can create a new vote via the Voting app to propose an execution of the Vault's \ntransferTokens()\n action. If, and only if, the vote passes, will the \ntransferTokens()\n action be executed.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the Voting app is also able to revoke or regrant the \nTRANSFER_TOKENS_ROLE\n permission as it is that permission's manager on \nvaultAppAddress\n.\n\n\nAdding Permissions\n\n\nApps have the choice of which actions to protect behind the ACL, as some actions may make sense to be completely public. Protecting an action behind the ACL is done in the smart contract by simply adding the authentication modifier \nauth()\n (passing the role required as a parameter) to the action. On executing the action, the \nauth()\n modifier checks with the Kernel whether the entity performing the call holds the required role or not.\n\n\nEscalating Permissions\n\n\nConsider kernel \nK\n, an entity \nE\n0\n, and an app \nA\n. \nE\n0\n wants to perform action \nA\nact\n on app \nA\n. The client knows, from \ninformation provided as part of the app's metadata\n, that in order to perform \nA\nact\n, an entity is required to have \nA\nrole\n. Since \nE\n0\n doesn't hold \nA\nrole\n, the client should know that \nE\n0\n cannot directly call \nA\nact\n, but that a list of entities [\nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n, ...] do have that role on app \nA\n. The client should then show the user the multiple possible forwarding paths to pass the call to \nE\n1\n, \nE\n2\n, etc, such that \nE\n0\n is able to perform \nA\nact\n through another, higher-privileged, entity.\n\n\nCalculating a forwarding path requires knowing what \nforwarders\n entity \nE\n0\n can escalate actions through. The user or contract performing this action could then choose their preferred route to forward permissions in order to perform \nA\nact\n. For example, \nE\n1\n may be a Voting app \nV\n, so the action would be to create a new vote that, in case of being approved, would call \nA\nact\n. Since \nV\n has role \nA\nrole\n, it has permission to execute \nA\nact\n, and therefore we would have successfully completed a permission escalation.\n\n\nPermission escalations can be multiple levels deep. For example, imagine a user wants to invoke an action that requires a vote. If the only entity with permission to create a vote is the \nToken Manager app\n, then the user will have to forward their action first through the Token Manager and then through the Voting app. The Token Manager only allows a sender to forward actions if the sender owns tokens, so in this case, the user will also need to hold tokens before being able to start a vote.\n\n\nNote that a permission escalation can occur instantly or be delayed and require further action from other entities, like in the case of the Voting app.\n\n\n\n\nForwarders\n\n\nIn order to make permission escalation easier, we define a common interface for \nForwarder\ns:\n\n\ncontract Forwarder {\n   bool isForwarder = true;\n   function canForward(address sender, bytes evmCallScript) view returns (bool);\n   function forward(bytes evmCallScript);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIf a user wants to enact an action it cannot perform directly, it can check if there are forwarders. This checks for privileged entities that are accessible to any of the user's addresses for forwarding the action to.\n\n\nEVM Call Script\n\n\nThe \nevmCallScript\n parameter in the \nForwarder's\n interface allows for executing multiple calls with just one transaction. This is useful, for example, in the case of votings, as it allows approving multiple actions with just one vote.\n\n\nAn \nevmCallScript\n is the concatenation of multiple \nevmCallAction\ns. A \nevmCallAction\n payload is:\n\n\n[ to (address: 20 bytes) ] [ calldataLength (uint32: 4 bytes)  ] [ calldata (calldataLength bytes) ]\n\n\nWhen executed, actions in the \nevmCallScript\n are executed one at a time using the \nCALL\n opcode. If any one of the actions fails (i.e. \nCALL\n returns 0), the entire execution is reverted.\n\n\nA reference implementation for EVM Call Script can be found here: \nEVMCallScript.sol\n.\n\n\n2. Upgradeability\n\n\nUpgradeability of the system is achieved by using the \nDelegateProxy\n pattern. Kernel and apps (\nKernelProxy\n and \nAppProxy\n) both use \nDelegateProxy\n with some added functionality.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that new versions of apps or the kernel run in the exact same context as previous versions, the old storage layout must be taken into account. Inheriting from the old contract's storage before adding new storage variables is considered a safe practice. It is recommended to make sure the upgrade doesn't break the storage before pushing a new version. We will work on tooling to prevent issues with storage when upgrading.\n\n\n2.1. Kernel upgradeability\n\n\nFor the \nKernel\n to be easily upgradeable, cheaply deployable, and more efficient, we use a proxy-type construct. Deploying a new DAO is done by deploying a \nKernelProxy\n contract that just delegates all calls to a kernel implementation at a given address, while still maintaining its own storage. Upgrading the kernel implementation in the proxy is as easy as changing its reference to another implementation's address.\n\n\nNote that, although this action is fairly easy to complete, it is extremely critical to the DAO and should be protected accordingly.\n\n\n2.2. App-space upgradeability\n\n\nAs apps can be used as entities (e.g. a voting app), it is important that each app is able to keep its address fixed to maintain its identity even if an upgrade changes the underlying logic. Keeping a fixed address also simplifies the upgrade process\u2014otherwise, each upgrade would also require any associated permissions in the ACL to be updated to the app's new address.\n\n\nOne way of achieving this is through the concept of an \nAppProxy\n contract (inspired by \naugur-core\u2019s \nDelegators\n). Deploying an app via an \nAppProxy\n contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version. The AppProxy contract then forwards the call by \ndelegatecall\ning into this address.\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that multiple \nAppProxy\n contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple \nFundraising\n \nAppProxy\n instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization. These upgrades could then be delegated to another contract, e.g. the Aragon Network, in case organizations don\u2019t want to handle manual upgrades of their own apps.\n\n\nSet App Code\n\n\nkernel.setAppCode(bytes32 appId, address appCode)\n\n\n\n\nThis action updates the implementation code registered for a given \nappId\n, such that all future calls to the app will use the new app code. If multiple app instances are installed for the given \nappId\n, they are all updated at the same time with this action.\n\n\nNote that all calls to an app will fail if an \nappId\n has not been set for its \nappCode\n.\n\n\n3. Initialization\n\n\nThe contracts that get deployed for each Kernel and app don't contain any business logic due to them relying on a proxy-like architecture for upgradeability. The proxy contracts are merely a way to point to the logic when called.\n\n\nHowever, this architecture impedes the ability to call the Solidity constructor. Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code.\n\n\nWe instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the \nAppProxy\n contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction, \nAppProxy\n allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps.\n\n\nIt is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy. Instead of just saving a boolean when a component has been initialized, we store the block number when the initialization occurred. Clients can then use this to know from which block they should filter for events.\n\n\n4. App discoverability and package versioning\n\n\nTechnically, an app \nA\n is nothing more than a simple \nAppProxy\n contract holding a reference to a kernel \nK\n and an \nappId\n. If \nA\n doesn\u2019t have any permissions, both incoming and outgoing, set in \nK\n, \nA\n is effectively irrelevant to the DAO as nothing can call it and it cannot call anything. So the notion of installing an app is replaced with the notion of creating permissions for an app (i.e. defining what entities can do with the app and what the app can do in other apps).\n\n\nAll relevant apps in a DAO should be discoverable by traversing its ACL, checking if any addresses are \nAppProxy\ns, and checking if those \nAppProxy\ns have a reference to the DAO\u2019s kernel. If that is the case, then the apps matching those \nAppProxy\ns' \nappId\ns are considered installed in the DAO.\n\n\nApplication identifiers (\nappId\ns) should be the \nnamehash\ned\n ENS name for the app's deployed contract:\n\n\nappId = namehash(\u201cvoting.aragonpm.eth\u201d)\n\n\n\n\nAn app's \nappId\n can be used as the identifier for its full package (including the app's frontend and other artifacts).\n\n\nAragon owns and provides \naragonpm.eth\n as a domain for developers to register their packages under. However, the system is designed to be domain agnostic: for example, district0x could decide to have all their packages under \npackages.district.eth\n.\n\n\nApp Repos\n\n\nAfter discovering an entity in the DAO that is an app, we can fetch its \nappId\n and use ENS to resolve its Repo contract:\n\n\nrepo = Resolver(ens.resolver(appId)).addr(appId)\n\n\n\n\nRepo contracts conform to the original Aragon Versioning Protocol but add more on-chain checks for version upgrades.\n\n\nEach Repo has an owner which is an Ethereum address that can create new versions of the package. This ownership right can be transferred to another address by the owner.\n\n\nA Repo keeps versioned state over:\n\n\n\n\nSmart contract app code (\ncontractAddress\n): the app code is the address of the deployed version of the app. The Kernel determines which version of the app it uses by pointing to the app code address associated with that version.\n\n\nPackage content (\ncontentURI\n): defined by a location ID of where the other components of the package (e.g. frontend) are hosted (IPFS, Swarm, etc.) and the content hash for fetching it.\n\n\n\n\nBy versioning both the app code address and the package content, we can build in additional expectations for the semantic versioning of apps:\n\n\n\n\nPatch\n: Minor changes to the package contents (e.g. frontend). Update can be performed silently for users.\n\n\nMinor\n: Major changes to the package contents, but still works with the current smart contract code. Users should be notified of the update.\n\n\nMajor\n: Any change to the smart contract app code with or without an accompanying frontend upgrade. User interaction is needed to upgrade.\n\n\n\n\nA correct version upgrade for a package is defined by the following rules:\n\n\n\n\nOnly one member of the version is increased by 1. The version components to the left of the raised member must stay the same and the components to the right must be 0.\n\n\nExample: From 2.1.3 the only allowed raises are to 3.0.0 (major version), 2.2.0 (minor version), and 2.1.4 (patch version).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the app code address can only be done if the raise changes the major version (upgrading it to x.0.0 by the above rule).\n\n\n\n\nBy having this check performed at the smart contract level, we can load the correct version of the frontend just by looking at an instance of an app. This is done by checking that the version of a smart contract is linked to a given app by getting its \nappId\n and \nappCode\n.\n\n\nAdditional Packaging Requirements\n\n\nThe package that is stored off-chain must contain a standard \nmanifest.json\n.\n\n\nWe also introduce a specific \neth.json\n file with the following keys, to help connect an app's frontend to its smart contracts:\n\n\n\n\nabi\n: Standard \nEthereum Contract ABI\n\n\nbytecode\n: Initialization code for deploying the app code to the network.\n\n\nfunctions\n: An array of all the relevant function signatures for the contract, with its \nnatspec\n description, argument names, and whether the function is protected by the ACL or not (and which role is required, if protected). These can be automatically generated on package publish.\n\n\npermissions\n: An array of permissions the app needs to have over other entities in order to work. This will probably be dependent on initialization parameters. For example: a Finance app will need permissions over the Vault it is initialized with.\n\n\nverification\n: An object providing the needed information to independently verify the source code of the deployed code. Required values include: \ndeployTxId\n, \nsourceCode\n, and the compiler settings, solc version, and optimization settings.\n\n\n\n\nAn initial implementation of the contracts supporting package management can be found in the \napm-contracts repo\n.",

One way of achieving this is through the concept of an  AppProxy  contract (inspired by  augur-core\u2019s  Delegators ). Deploying an app via an  AppProxy  contract only requires a reference to the Kernel and the app identifier. When the app receives a call, it gets intercepted by the proxy's fallback function. At this point, the proxy asks the Kernel for the latest address of the app code for a given app identifier and version.

It should be noted that multiple  AppProxy  contracts can be installed in a DAO for the same app identifier (e.g. multiple  Fundraising   AppProxy  instances can be attached to the same Kernel to control multiple types of funding). As the Kernel keeps a centralized record of the latest version of the code for each app identifier, changing one reference in the Kernel effectively updates all instances of that app in that organization.

Constructors are run only on contract creation but not stored as part of the account code.  We instead use a 'regular function' to perform initialization on each proxy. This function can only be called after the  AppProxy  contract has been deployed. To impede attacks in which a malicious actor tries to front-run an initialization transaction between the deployment and the legit initialization transaction,  AppProxy  allows you to pass an initialization payload that will only be executed on deployment, allowing for atomic initializations of apps.  It is important that this initialization function can only be called once per proxy.

We also introduce a specific  eth.json  file with the following keys, to help connect an app's frontend to its smart contracts:   abi : Standard  Ethereum Contract ABI  bytecode : Initialization code for deploying the app code to the network.  functions : An array of all the relevant function signatures for the contract, with its  natspec  description, argument names, and whether the function is protected by the ACL or not (and which role is required, if protected). These can be automatically generated on package publish.  permissions : An array of permissions the app needs to have over other entities in order to work. This will probably be dependent on initialization parameters. For example: a Finance app will need permissions over the Vault it is initialized with.  verification : An object providing the needed information to independently verify the source code of the deployed code. Required values include:  deployTxId ,  sourceCode , and the compiler settings, solc version, and optimization settings.   An initial implementation of the contracts supporting package management can be found in the  apm-contracts repo .",
